It investigates the particular set of aesthetic and social forces and desires that result in and emerge from the seemingly simple phenomenon of black people looking at each other. Is that phenomenon an action or an event? Does that looking presuppose or produce subjects and objects? What work does such looking do on or for or to or against the world? In addressing these questions, the talk also seeks to contribute to an analysis of class struggle in black studies.\n\nFred Moten is Professor of English at the University of California, Riverside, where he teaches courses and conducts research in black studies, performance studies, poetics and literary theory. He is author of In the Break: The Aesthetics of the Black Radical Tradition (University of Minnesota Press, 2003); Hughson\u2019s Tavern (Leon Works, 2009); B. Jenkins (Duke University Press, 2010); The Feel Trio (Letter Machine Editions, 2014), which was a poetry finalist for the National Book Award and Los Angeles Times Book Prize and winner of the California Book Award for poetry; The Little Edges (Wesleyan University Press, 2015), which was a finalist for the Kingsley Tufts Poetry Award and The Service Porch (Letter Machine Editions, 2016). Moten is also co-author, with Stefano Harney, of The Undercommons: Fugitive Planning and Black Study (Minor Compositions/Autonomedia, 2013) and, with Wu Tsang, of Who touched me? (If I Can\u2019t Dance, I Don't Want to be Part of Your Revolution, 2016). His current projects include two critical texts, consent not to be a single being (forthcoming from Duke University Press) and Hesitant Sociology: Blackness and Poetry, which extend his study of black art and social life. Moten is a 2016 Guggenheim Fellow.\n\nProfessor Eric Schocket taught American literature at Hampshire College from 1996 until his death in 2006. A much-admired teacher and colleague, his courses inspired a generation of students. Nationally, he was a leading figure in working-class studies. His writings on figures like Herman Melville, Rebecca Harding Davis, William Dean Howells, and Langston Hughes engaged the important relationship between class and culture. His book, Vanishing Moments: Class and American Literature, was published in 2006.\nFor more information, please contact Linda Green (lgreen@hampshire.edu), Assistant to the Dean in the School of Humanities, Arts and Cultural Studies at Hampshire.

Prof. at the University of Colorado, Boulder\n\nWhite supremacists, ethnic separatists and cultural ultraconservatives populate Sweden\u2019s scene of self-identified nationalists. Despite pronounced ideological and social differences among nationalists, most can trace their activism to a cultural movement that engulfed Western Europe during the 1990s: skinheadism.\n\nSkinhead style and white power music provided vital fundraising and recruiting channels for radical nationalists in Sweden. But with its hooliganism, male chauvinism and hate rhetoric, this subculture also repulsed much of the Swedish mainstream, and prevented opponents of immigration from making appreciable political gains. Teitelbaum's talk explores activists' efforts to reject skinheadism and refashion themselves as upstanding agents of love and justice. He connects this reformist campaign with nationalists\u2019 emerging interest in showcasing traditional femininities in their expressive culture. His analysis centers on the works and reception of Swedish singer Saga\u2014currently the most popular musician in the greater white nationalist world. He shows how Saga and similar artists create gendered portrayals of white victimization in their music, portrayals that reinforce (male) nationalists\u2019 images of themselves as defenders of the oppressed. Teitelbaum's discussion offers insight into the shifting conceptual terrain of radical nationalism at a time when this movement is achieving unprecedented political gains throughout the Nordic region and Europe beyond."},

In its heyday, a hat was the punctuation mark, the final inflection of the sentence that was the outfit for both men and women. Beginning with illustrations derived from 30's screwball comedies, Margaret Bruzelius will discuss the patterns of meaning in hats in film: high crown versus low crown, broad versus narrow brim, feathers and trim, and where and how the hat fits on the head.\n\nNow that the hat is largely a stretchy wool or acrylic cap worn in cold weather wear to preserve our ears, the discourse of hats is now opaque to us. But hats, like every other part of the system of clothing, have always sent messages about their wearers: hats have their rhetorics, even if that rhetoric is no longer familiar. Historic Northampton's hats are now separated from their wearers and the clothes they once accessorized, but we can, by thinking about basic hat vocabulary, once again appreciate the messages sent by the feather cocktail hat, the high leather fedora, the cherry bedecked straw hat, the bright straw summer hat.\n\nMargaret Bruzelius is the dean of the senior class and associate dean of Smith College.

Their exclusive authority to produce and use atomic weapons\u2014codified by the Atomic Energy Act of 1946\u2014led to further expansions of presidential powers not conferred by the constitution. The authority to launch globe-threatening weapons has led to a wide range of additional assertions of power unaccountable to the public or its elected representatives, including covert overthrows of foreign governments, secret bombing of foreign nations, unilateral abdication of treaties, warrantless surveillance of American citizens, and routine circumvention of Congress\u2019s constitutional power to declare war.\n\nThis lecture will argue that nuclear weapons are inherently undemocratic and must be abolished before we can begin dismantling the national security state and restoring genuinely representative government.\nProfessor Appy will be presented with the Chancellor\u2019s Medal, the highest recognition bestowed to faculty by the campus, at the conclusion of the lecture.\n\nThis lecture is free and open to the public.

We are students, activists, researchers, scholars, advocates, and justice-seekers. We come together. We vision. We share our successes and challenges. We hold each other accountable. We share our experiences. \n \nWith lifelong activists, newly inspired justice-seekers, veteran CLPP conference goers, and first-timers, the conference home that we are creating is approaching its 40th year. We celebrate our strength because we survive and share our resources so that we continue to thrive.  We come together to share power and build new skills. We come together to build the movement for reproductive freedom. We come home.\n \nOur communities are strong and resilient. The reproductive justice movement was birthed by women of color who said, We can\u2019t experience our power without abortion, without support for our families, without celebrating our choices to parent or not to parent, and without justice. At the annual CLPP conference, we join together to celebrate this strong legacy of justice-making and to build our movements.\n \nAt the conference, we strive to create a space where those at the frontlines of our struggles for justice are centered and our lived experiences are valued. Our vision is to create a home for the visible leadership of those most impacted by reproductive injustices: women of color, trans women, LGBTQ people, those who have been incarcerated, poor and working class people, youth, students, people with disabilities, immigrants, indigenous people, and others who are most acutely affected by reproductive, environmental, and social injustices. \n \nWe come together to listen and learn, to hold space to respond to the traumas inflicted upon our communities. We know that coming home is not always comfortable. We interrogate our discomfort. We expand our conversations about race and racism\u2014about white supremacy\u2014affirming that Black Lives Matter is central to achieving reproductive justice. \n \nWe know that coming home is hard work. At the CLPP conference, we center our desires for justice, and we hold back the tide. We vision for ourselves, our communities, our environments, and our society. \n \nWe celebrate the ways that we are creating the world that we want to live in. We tell our stories of abortions that we wanted, that we didn\u2019t want, that we had to fight for, and that we could not live without. We celebrate our creations\u2014our art, our stories, our families, our communities. We tell stories of the children and families we have had to fight to create. We celebrate through story, and we envision a world where each of us experiences power, pleasure, and autonomy.\n \nCome home to the CLPP conference to be inspired. Come to the conference to recalibrate for action. Come to celebrate the beauty and resilience of our movements. Reconnect with old friends, meet new strategic partners and mentors. Come create space with your communities and with new communities\u2014to build a vision centering diverse histories, identities, experiences and narratives. We don\u2019t all come to the CLPP conference as leaders, but we all take back new stories and skills to empower our communities.  \n \nWe hope you will share both your experiences and your desire to learn with us on April 7-9, 2017. Join us to find out how your work, your communities, and the issues you care about are part of the movement we are building for reproductive freedom."},

In Shrill, Lindy West explores how to survive in a cold, judgmental world and shares how to weather hatred, loneliness, harassment, and loss and still walk away laughing. Ferociously witty and candid, Lindy West is a rare and bewitching talent whose body of work has garnered a coast-to-coast audience of prominent writers, press, booksellers, and men and women alike who are not afraid to hold an honest (and mostly unflattering) mirror up to our own culture.\n \nFrom a painfully shy childhood in which she tried, unsuccessfully, to hide her big body and even bigger opinions; to her public war with stand-up comedians over rape jokes; to her struggle to convince herself, and then the world, that fat people have value; to her accidental activism and never-ending battle royale with Internet trolls, Lindy narrates her life with a blend of humor and pathos that manages to make a trip to the abortion clinic funny and wring tears out of a story about diarrhea.\n \nShrill provocatively dissects what it means to become self-aware the hard way, to go from wanting to be silent and invisible to earning a living defending the silenced in all caps.\n \nLindy West is a Seattle-based writer, editor, and performer whose work focuses on pop culture, social justice, humor, and body image. She\u2019s currently a culture writer for GQ magazine and a weekly columnist at The Guardian, as well as the founder and editor of I Believe You | It\u2019s Not your Fault, an advice blog for teens.  In 2015 she wrote and recorded a story for \u201cThis American Life\u201d about confronting an Internet troll who impersonated her dead father and was half of the duo who initiated #shoutyourabortion, which landed her on the cover of The New York Times.

Two applications use online user interactions:\n1) WebGazer uses interaction data made on any website to continuously calibrate a webcam-based eye tracker, so that users can manipulate any web page solely by looking.\n2) Drafty tracks interactions with a detailed table of computer science professors to ask the crowd of readers to help keep structured data up-to-date by inferring their interests. And two applications use mobile sensing data:\n3) SleepCoacher uses smartphone sensors to capture noise and movement data while people sleep to automatically generate recommendations about how to sleep better through a continuous cycle of mini-experiments.\n4) Rewind uses passive location tracking on smartphones to recreate a person's past memory through a fusion of geolocation, street side imagery, and weather data. Together, these systems show how subtle footprints of user behavior collected remotely can reimagine the way we gaze at websites, improve our sleep, experience the past, and maintain changing data.\n\nJeff Huang is an Assistant Professor in Computer Science at Brown University. His research in human-computer interaction focuses on behavior-powered systems, spanning the domains of mobile devices, personal informatics, and web search. Jeff's Ph.D. is in Information Science from the University of Washington in Seattle, and his masters and undergraduate degrees are in Computer Science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Before joining Brown, he analyzed search behavior at Microsoft Research, Google, Yahoo, and Bing, and he co-founded World Blender, a Techstars-backed company that made geolocation mobile games.

Is it possible to become someone new, or does our history determine our future? And in any life that contains a before and an after, how is it possible to be one person, not two?\n \nOn a warm August night in 1980, six college students are up to no good inside the dilapidated ruins of Philadelphia\u2019s notoriously haunted Eastern State Penitentiary. It\u2019s not long before they realize they are locked in and not alone, and the terrible night ends in tragedy. Years later, one of them\u2014celebrity chef Jon Casey\u2014will finally be charged with murder, but will Jon\u2019s old friend Judith Carrigan testify to his innocence? Judith is protecting long-held and hard-won secrets of her own, and to defend her friend, she risks not only sacrificing the life she has fought to build but also potentially losing her husband and son.

The gas-phase is mainly molecular and contains many exotic species, including radicals, unusual isomers, and anions, most of which are organic in nature. Although hydrogen is the dominant element and H2 the dominant gas-phase molecule, most organic molecules are very unsaturated and are labeled \u201ccarbon chains\u201d by astronomers. The dust particles are covered with ices, mainly in the form of water, CO, and CO2. During the collapse, the material evolves through a number of stages starting with an isothermal era, followed by a warm-up during which the gas-phase molecular inventory changes from a mainly exotic one to one in which most organic molecules resemble standard laboratory solvents, albeit in the gas phase. Eventually a so-called protoplanetary disk is formed around the young star, and the disk can lead to the formation of planets via coagulation of the dust particles, with an initial molecular inventory at least partially determined by the chemistry that has already occurred.\n\nMuch of what we know about the physical conditions and lifetimes of the various stages of star formation derives from molecules, which, through spectroscopy and kinetic modeling, are excellent probes of sources where they exist.1 In this talk, I will discuss the types of gas-phase and solid-state processes that synthesize molecules in assorted regions of star formation, with an emphasis on exotic gas-phase reactions and the chemistry that occurs in ice mantles."},

Fugitive Science chronicles a little-known story about race and science in America. While the history of scientific racism in the nineteenth century has been well-documented, there was also a counter-movement of African Americans who worked to refute its claims.  \n\nFar from rejecting science, these figures were careful readers of antebellum science who linked diverse fields\u2014from astronomy to physiology\u2014to both on-the-ground activism and more speculative forms of knowledge creation. Routinely excluded from institutions of scientific learning and training, they transformed cultural spaces like the page, the stage, the parlor, and even the pulpit into laboratories of knowledge and experimentation. From the recovery of neglected figures like Robert Benjamin Lewis, Hosea Easton, and Sarah Mapps Douglass, to new accounts of Martin Delany, Henry Box Brown, and Frederick Douglass, Fugitive Science makes natural science central to how we understand the origins and development of African American literature and culture. \n\nThis distinct and pioneering book will spark interest from anyone wishing to learn more on race and society."},
