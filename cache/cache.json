Liberalism has been employed to identify the dynamics within Islamic thought and distinguish between \u201cmoderate,\u201d \u201cconservative\u201d and \u201cextremist\u201d Islams. In this context, historians have engaged with \u201cIslam and liberalism\u201d, \u201cIslam in liberalism\u201d, and \u201cIslam after liberalism.\u201d But is there an Islam without liberalism?\nProf. Ghazal\u2019s talk examines a strand of religious thought during the \u201cliberal age\u201d that refused to accept the premises of liberalism, did not define Islam in relationship to it, and, more importantly, defended Islam against it. The proponents of this thought understood liberalism not only as championing social, cultural and religious values menacing to Islam and Muslims, but also as a political project aimed to destroy Islam. For them, liberalism embodied the battle between Christianity and Islam, and that between Europe and the Ottoman Empire. Therefore, they considered those Muslim modernists who promoted liberalism as traitors to Islam and facilitators of colonial projects. The Sufi scholar Yusuf al-Nabhani (1849\u20131932) best articulated these views. The lecture also addresses the polemics between al-Nabhani and Wahhabis who shared his disdain for liberalism. With the relative eclipse of Sufism in the Arab world in the 20th century and the eventual rise of Wahhabism, the battle to defend Islam against liberalism was largely left to the Wahhabis. The lecture concludes by suggesting that there is an intellectual genealogy linking al-Nabhani and his Wahhabi counterparts to a group like ISIS in its deliberate attempt to define and portray Islam as being opposed to values associated with liberalism.\nAmal Ghazal is Associate Professor of History & Director of the Center for Comparative Study of Muslim Societies and Cultures at Simon Fraser University. She is a known specialist on modern Islamic reform movements. "},

Although some variability in fish catches is expected across factors such as location and season, we know less about how large\u2010scale disturbances like climate change will influence population variability. The Laurentian Great Lakes in North America are the largest group of freshwater lakes in the world, and they have experienced major changes due to fluctuations in pollution and nutrient loadings, exploitation of natural resources, introductions of non\u2010native species, and shifting climatic patterns. This project analyzed established long\u2010term data about important fish populations from across the Great Lakes basin, including from Oneida Lake in New York, Lake Michigan and the Bay of Quinte in Lake Ontario. Our objective was to evaluate spatial and temporal variation in fish catches from large freshwater lakes that have experienced large\u2010scale changing conditions. We evaluated analytical approaches with the potential to disentangle sources of variability in standardized monitoring data. Specifically, we considered 1) how the decomposition of spatial and temporal variation in fish catches can be used to measure a response to perturbation; 2) how truncation of population age structure can alter population oscillations which may shift how a population is affected by environmental fluctuations; and 3) how the composition of a fish community may respond to a suite of environmental drivers through time. Using long\u2010term gill\u2010net data for walleye, we found that average catch and variance structure differed before and after large\u2010scale perturbations. More generally, our results suggest that fish population responses to changing environments can be complex, but that long\u2010term monitoring combined with modeling approaches can allow for detection of quantifiable changes.\n\nVidal recently graduated from the University of Georgia, where she focused on characterizing spatial and temporal variability in fish populations in the Great Lakes region. In her current position, she works on recreational fisheries issues including contributing to stock assessments, evaluating management measures, and conducting directed research to address important knowledge gaps.\n\n"},

A century later, Machu Picchu is a UNESCO world heritage site visited by more than a million tourists annually. This remarkable transformation began with the photographs that accompanied Bingham\u2019s article published in National Geographicmagazine, which depicted Machu Picchu as a lost city discovered. Focusing on the practices, technologies, and materializations of Bingham\u2019s three expeditions to Peru (1911, 1912, 1914\u20131915), this book makes a convincing case that visualization, particularly through the camera, played a decisive role in positioning Machu Picchu as both a scientific discovery and a Peruvian heritage site.\n\n6:00-8:00pm, FCWSRC, 83 College Street, Mount Holyoke College, South Hadley"},

Police officers threw out first pitches, returning veterans were honored at half-time. Sports events began to seem like advertisements for the military and law enforcement.  In the wake of the shootings of black men, the acquittal of white police officers who shot them, and the resurgence of white supremacy groups, black athletes like LeBron James and and Carmelo Anthony are reviving a tradition of activism that reaches back to Jackie Robinson and Mohammed Ali.  Howard Bryant traces this history and looks at how black athletes today are refusing to \"shut up and play\" and are helping to change what patriotism looks like on the sports field.\nHoward Bryant is a senior writer for ESPN, an NPR correspondent, and the author of Juicing the Game: Drugs, Power and the Fight for the Soul  of Major League Baseball,  The Last Hero: A Life of Henry Aaron, and  a book for young readers, Legends: The Best  Players, Games and Teams in Baseball."},
