Based on ultrasound-supported three-dimensional (3-D) cell culture in a multi-well microplate, the method is gentle and can be used for producing various tissue-mimicking 3-D structures in parallel. It is based on ultrasonic-standing-wave particle manipulation inside hundreds of micro-wells in the microplate. The method consists of analysis and optimization of the driving parameters of the ultrasound transducer attached to the microplate, and demonstration of the production of various micro-engineered models of solid tumors. Vilund and his colleagues have primarily used cells from HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma and A498 renal carcinoma cell lines as building blocks in the tumor models, but have also tested the method with fibroblasts, thyroid cells and melanoma cells.\n\nThe solid tumor models are characterized on-chip by detailed 3-D confocal and light-sheet microscopy, and off-chip with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Furthermore, the team has developed an image analysis-based method for cell counting and characterization in 3-D, and have studied protein expression in tumor models by FACS, comparing 2-D and 3-D cultures. The selected proteins for the analysis are relevant ligands for natural killer (NK) cell recognition. The results show differences in protein expression levels between 2-D and 3-D cultures. This is of interest when optimizing future treatment protocols in NK cell-based cancer immunotherapy."},

To better understand these complicated systems, Hess and his colleagues built a quantum magnet from the ground up using trapped and levitated atomic ions.\n\nHess will discuss how they used this experimental platform to realize a new phase of matter called a discrete time crystal. These time crystals are a kind of self-stabilizing clock, a behavior which could be turned on and off by changing the interactions between the magnetic spins in the trapped ion crystal.\n\n"},

Learning to deal with congestion in crowds and in networks is a long-standing and urgently-studied problem, one that can be equally well described at the level of dense, correlated matter or at the level of game-theoretical decision making. In this talk I describe two related problems associated with motion planning in congested environments. In the first part I consider a description of pedestrian crowds as densely-packed repulsive particles, and I address the question: what is the form of the pedestrian-pedestrian interaction law?

Amid public outcry, an immediate manhunt was on to catch the murderer, and a young African-American man was quickly apprehended, charged, and \u2014 wrongly \u2014 convicted of the crime. Dick Lehr, a former reporter for the Boston Globe\u2019s famous Spotlight Team who investigated this case for the newspaper, now turns the story into Trell, a page-turning novel about the daughter of an imprisoned man who persuades a reporter and a lawyer to help her prove her father\u2019s innocence. What pieces of evidence might have been overlooked? Can they manage to get to the truth before a dangerous character from the neighborhood gets to them?\n \nDick Lehr is a professor of journalism at Boston University. From 1985 to 2003, he was a reporter at the Boston Globe, where he was a Pulitzer Prize finalist in investigative reporting and won numerous regional and national journalism awards. He served as the Globe's legal affairs reporter, magazine and feature writer, and as a longtime member of the newspaper's investigative reporting unit, the Spotlight Team. Before that, Lehr, who is also an attorney, was a reporter at The Hartford Courant.\n \nLehr is the author of The Fence: A Police Cover-up Along Boston's Racial Divide, a non-fiction narrative about the worst known case of police brutality in Boston, which was an Edgar Award finalist for best non-fiction. He is coauthor of the New York Times bestseller and Edgar Award winner Black Mass: Whitey Bulger, the FBI and a Devil's Deal, and its sequel, Whitey: The Life of America's Most Notorious Mob Boss.\n \nLehr was a John S. Knight Journalism Fellow at Stanford University in 1991-1992. He lives outside Boston with his wife and four children.\n \n \nDisappeared \n \nYou've never read a Francisco X. Stork novel like this before! A missing girl, a determined reporter, and a young man on the brink combine for a powerful story of choices, suspense, and survival. Four Months Ago: Sara Zapata's best friend disappeared, kidnapped by the web of criminals who terrorize Juarez. Four Hours Ago: Sara received a death threat \u2014 and with it, a clue to the place where her friend is locked away. Four Weeks Ago: Emiliano Zapata fell in love with Perla Rubi, who will never be his so long as he's poor. Four Minutes Ago: Emiliano got the chance to make more money than he ever dreamed \u2014 just by joining the web. In the next four days, Sara and Emiliano will each face impossible choices, between life and justice, friends and family, truth and love. But when the web closes in on Sara, only one path remains for the siblings: the way across the desert to the United States.\n \nFrancisco Xavier Arguelles was born in 1953 in Monterrey, Mexico. His mother, Ruth Arguelles, was a single woman from a middle-class family in Tampico. Six years later Ruth married Charles Stork, a retired man of Dutch ancestry, who adopted Francisco. When Francisco announced that he wanted to be a writer, Charlie gave him a portable typewriter for his seventh birthday. Two years later, Francisco and his family moved to El Paso, Texas, where he was sent to grammar school to learn English. As a teenager, Francisco was given a scholarship to the local Jesuit academy and soon rose to the top of his class. Based on his success there, he received an honors scholarship to attend Spring Hill College, a small Jesuit school in Mobile, Alabama. Francisco majored in English literature and philosophy and received the college\u201ds creative writing prize. He was awarded the prestigious Danforth Fellowship to attend graduate school at Harvard University, where he studied Latin American literature with writers like Octavio Paz, the Mexican Nobel Laureate. After four years at Harvard, Francisco went to Columbia Law School, planning to make a living as a lawyer while writing fiction. Twenty years, and twelve or so legal jobs later, he published his first novel for adults, The Way of the Jaguar. Francisco X. Stork works in Boston as an attorney for a state agency that develops affordable housing. He is married and has two adult children.\n "},

In this book--the first of its kind--mathematician and mathematical artist Henry Segerman takes readers on a fascinating tour of two-, three-, and four-dimensional mathematics, exploring Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometries, symmetry, knots, tilings, and soap films. Visualizing Mathematics with 3D Printing includes more than 100 color photographs of 3D printed models. Readers can take the book's insights to a new level by visiting its sister website, 3dprintmath.com, which features virtual three-dimensional versions of the models for readers to explore. These models can also be ordered online or downloaded to print on a 3D printer.\n\nCombining the strengths of book and website, this volume pulls higher geometry and topology out of the realm of the abstract and puts it into the hands of anyone fascinated by mathematical relationships of shape. With the book in one hand and a 3D printed model in the other, readers can find deeper meaning while holding a hyperbolic honeycomb, touching the twists of a torus knot, or caressing the curves of a Klein quartic.\n \nHenry Segerman is one of the leading figures in the new world of math and 3D printing.

Proponents of UBI have theorized that putting such a system into place could potentially even eradicate poverty altogether, while reducing the bureaucracy associated with current methods of social welfare assistance provision and also boosting economic growth.\nRecent advances in artificial intelligence, robotics, and related technologies challenge the notion that plentiful jobs will be available for those seeking work. Self-driving trucks, for example, could spur the elimination of hundreds of thousands or even millions of jobs, many of which will not be replaced. If many citizens are unable to find traditional work, both individuals and society will need to adapt to a new social and economic reality. How should society support those who cannot find work because technology has displaced jobs?\nIn this moderated panel discussion UBI experts Connie Razza, Seth Ackerman and Elizabeth Rhodes will discuss the history of this theory and the implications of putting such a system in place.\nRazza is director of strategic research at the Center for Popular Democracy and co-director of policy and research at Demos, a public policy organization.\nAckerman is a member of the editorial board of Jacobin, where he has published prominently on Universal Basic Income reform.\nRhodes is research director for the Basic Income Project, Y Combinator Research.\nThe Annual Freedman Lecture is sponsored by Robert J.

With no money, no family, no job or security, she hopes to salvage something of her former life and the lives of the hired men and their families who depend on her. The buffalo hunt that her husband had planned, she now realizes, was his last hope for saving their land.\n \nElizabeth and Michael plunge south across the aptly named Deadline demarcating Indian Territory from their home state, Kansas. Nothing could have prepared them for the dangers: rattlesnakes, rabies, wildfire, lightning strikes, blue northers, flash floods, threats to life in so many ways. They're on borrowed time: the Comanche are in winter quarters, and the cruel work of slaughtering the buffalo is unraveling their souls. They must get back alive.\n \nThis is a gripping narrative of that infamous hunt, which drove the buffalo population to near extinction--the story of a moment in our history in which mass destruction of an animal population was seen as the only route to economic solvency. But it's also the intimate story of how that hunt changed Michael and Elizabeth forever.\n\nRobert Olmstead is the author of six previous books.

Debates over historical representation have played an integral role in the language politics of\npost-Soviet Russian culture, and the complex place of 1917 in forms of collective identity and memory exemplifies this phenomenon.

Gorham is Professor of Russian Studies at the University of Florida. Trained in Russian linguistics, literature, and cultural studies, his research explores the intersection of language, culture and politics in Russia, focusing on periods of social transition. Professor Gorham\u2019s current projects explore Russian language politics and civil communication in the context of the Internet and new media technologies, which have reconfigured the Russian public sphere of the Putin era.

In recent years more than 55% of this budget\u2014our income taxes\u2014has been spent on war and weapon purchase accounts. Recently President Trump proposed more cuts in key programs supporting education and research\u2014including NIH, NSF, EPA, and NOAA\u2014in order to fund a $54 billion increase (~10%) in military spending. This will bring the fraction of our tax dollars spent on preparation for war to more than 60% of the total congressional budget. Many of the weapons programs\u2014such as the proposed trillion-dollar nuclear weapons \u201cmodernization\u201d\u2014are provocative and destabilizing, more likely to decrease national security than increase it. The excessive costs will greatly weaken programs addressing social needs. Defending higher education and basic research will require explicitly resisting the diversion of our tax dollars to military accounts.\n \nSpeaker Biography:\nJonathan Alan King is professor of molecular biology at MIT, where he has long taught biochemistry and directed biomedical research on protein misfolding and human disease <http://web.mit.edu/king-lab>.

Though the storm is fast approaching the Louisiana coast, Cora, the family's fragile elder daughter, refuses to leave the city, forcing her parents, Joe Boisdore, an artist descended from a freed slave who became one of the city's preeminent furniture makers, and his white \"Uptown\" wife, Dr. Tess Eshleman, to evacuate without her, setting off a chain of events that leaves their marriage in shambles and Cora catatonic--the victim or perpetrator of some violence mysterious even to herself.\n \nThis mystery is at the center of C. Morgan Babst's haunting, lyrical novel. Cora's sister, Del, returns to New Orleans from the life she has tried to build in New York City to find her hometown in ruins and her family deeply alienated from one another. As Del attempts to figure out what happened to her sister, she must also reckon with the racial history of the city, and the trauma of destruction that was not, in fact, some random act of God, but an avoidable tragedy visited upon New Orleans's most helpless and forgotten citizens.\n \nThe Floating World is the Katrina story that needed to be told--one with a piercing, unforgettable loveliness and a nuanced understanding of this particular place and its tangled past, written by a New Orleans native who herself says that after Katrina, \"if you were blind, suddenly you saw.\n \nC. Morgan Babst studied writing at NOCCA, Yale, and N.Y.U.

Declining upward mobility in the United States is now understood as a local problem, which could be addressed through place-based policy. Relatively little is known, however, of the malleability or historical evolution of places with respect to mobility outcomes. This article uses a new linked sample of over three million parents and children to study the historical geography of opportunity. This analysis reveals dramatic change in which places promoted and constrained upward mobility over the twentieth century. This changing geography of opportunity appears to have been partially precipitated by cycles of regional economic development. The territorial imprint of historical race relations, immigration and ethnic diversity, in contrast, is still evident in mobility differences today. This research suggests that strategies aimed at enhancing upward mobility should promote economic opportunity while contending with more deeply rooted differences between places.\n\nDr. Dylan Connor, Research Associate at the University of Colorado, Boulder, will give a talk titled \"Stability and Change in the Land of Opportunity over the Twentieth Century."},

And although these patterns don\u2019t doom women to electoral failure, they raise a formidable series of obstacles that complicate women\u2019s path to elective office. Or so the conventional wisdom goes. This lecture will challenge that prevailing view and argue that the declining novelty of women in politics, coupled with the polarization of the Republican and Democratic parties, has left little space for the sex of a candidate to influence modern campaigns. Based on an in-depth analysis of the 2010 and 2014 congressional elections, Jennifer L. Lawless will demonstrate that male and female House candidates communicate similar messages on the campaign trail, receive similar coverage in the local press, and garner similar evaluations from voters in their districts. Gender is by no means irrelevant, but when they run for office, male and female candidates don\u2019t just perform equally well on Election Day -- they also face a very similar electoral landscape. The problem for women\u2019s representation, however, if that women are less likely than men to throw their hats into the electoral ring in the first place.\n---\nJennifer L.

Her work has appeared in academic journals including the American Political Science Review, American Journal of Political Science, Perspectives on Politics, Journal of Politics, Political Research Quarterly, Legislative Studies Quarterly, and Politics & Gender (of which she served as editor from 2010 \u2013 2013). \n\nShe is also a nationally recognized speaker on electoral politics.

We survey recent work in the model of  \"local computation algorithms\" which for a given input, supports queries by a user to values of  specified bits of a legal output.  The goal is to design local computation algorithms in such a way that very little of the input needs to be seen in order to determine the value of any single bit of the output.\n\nIn this talk, we describe results on a variety of problems for which sublinear time and space local computation algorithms have been developed -- we will give special focus to finding maximal independent sets and sparse  spanning graphs."},
