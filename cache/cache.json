It will focus on theoretical and practical questions related to the nature of the writing process and the challenges of teaching writing, particularly in light of the current literacy standards. The aim of the course will be to provide participants opportunities to reflect on their own literacy learning and teaching experiences, to explore composition theory and research, and to examine current issues in the teaching of writing.  Readings and research projects will focus on writing process and its linguistic, psychological, and socio-cultural underpinnings. Concepts such as audience, voice, identity, and dialect \u2013 as well as practical matters such as teaching grammar, working with English Language Learners, and incorporating technology \u2013 will all be considered.\n\nA key assumption of this course is that the best way to learn about writing is to write \u2013 in a variety of modes and for a range of purposes \u2013 and to reflect on the complex processes involved in that act. Participants can expect to write regularly: low-stakes experiments in different genres, informal reading responses, portfolio reflections, a literacy self-study, and a well-documented research essay will all be part of the mix. Class meetings will include discussions, workshops, response groups, and presentations."},
