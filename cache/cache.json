Pooja Rangan argues that this vicious circle is the result of immediation, a prevailing documentary ethos that seeks to render human suffering urgent and immediate at all costs. Rangan interrogates this ethos in films seeking to \u201cgive a voice to the voiceless,\u201d an established method of validating the humanity of marginalized subjects, including children, refugees, autistics, and animals. \n\nDiscussants: Amy Cox Hall (Visiting Assistant Professor of Anthropology, Amherst College) Amelie Hastie (Professor of English in Film and Media Studies, Amherst College), Jina Kim (Mount Holyoke Fellow/Visiting Lecturer in Critical Social Thought and Assistant Professor of English and the Study of Women and Gender, Smith College) and Bernadine Mellis (Five College Senior Lecturer in Film & Video Production)  "},

She situates Native identity among theories of diaspora, cosmopolitanism, and transnationalism by examining urban narratives\u2014such as those written by Sherman Alexie, Janet Campbell Hale, Louise Erdrich, and Susan Power\u2014along with the work of filmmakers and artists. In these stories Native peoples navigate new surroundings, find and reformulate community, and maintain and redefine Indian identity in the postrelocation era. These narratives illuminate the changing relationship between urban Indigenous peoples and their tribal nations and territories and the ways in which new cosmopolitan bonds both reshape and are interpreted by tribal identities.\n\nDiscussants: Christine DeLucia (Assistant Professor of History, Mount Holyoke College), Laura Doyle (Professor of English, UMass Amherst), Laura Fugikawa (Visiting Assistant Professor in the Study of Women and Gender and English Language and Literatures, Smith College), and Kiara Vigil (Assistant Professor of American Studies, Amherst College)"},

A century later, Machu Picchu is a UNESCO world heritage site visited by more than a million tourists annually. This remarkable transformation began with the photographs that accompanied Bingham\u2019s article published in National Geographicmagazine, which depicted Machu Picchu as a lost city discovered. Focusing on the practices, technologies, and materializations of Bingham\u2019s three expeditions to Peru (1911, 1912, 1914\u20131915), this book makes a convincing case that visualization, particularly through the camera, played a decisive role in positioning Machu Picchu as both a scientific discovery and a Peruvian heritage site.\n\n6:00-8:00pm, FCWSRC, 83 College Street, Mount Holyoke College, South Hadley"},
