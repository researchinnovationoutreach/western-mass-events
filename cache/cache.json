However, the physics of granular media present significant complexities that are still poorly understood. Impact of granular targets by solid projectiles is an experimental approach to understanding force transmission in soft matter. A granular target can cause a free-falling projectile to come to an abrupt stop as its momentum is dissipated to the grains. A complete interpretation of the stopping force, incorporating grain-scale interactions during impact, remains unresolved. We use direct force measurements and high-speed imaging to determine the forces acting on a projectile as it decelerates through a dense granular medium. These impact studies probe the unique response and properties of granular media."},

Mr. Fishman developed a bat research program on Long Island, New York, to determine how WNS had impacted bat populations there. The resulting Long Island Century Bat Survey (LICBS), the most intensive bat survey conducted on Long Island in more than 100 years, revealed some surprising results.

Yifa has been a first-hand witness of many changes and revivals within the Buddhist community in China. In her lecture, the Ven. Yifa will share her reflections on the phenomena of Buddhist rejuvenation in current China. During the first phase in the 1980's after China's Cultural Revolution, Buddhist leaders derived policies to revive Buddhism. During the second phase, after the thirty years of Deng Xiaoping's economic reforms, reconstruction of giant temples and monasteries on historical sites mushroomed around the country. Under the surface of massive temple reconstruction, we find struggles sparking between the monastic communities that want to uphold cultural traditions, local governments seeking revenue from entrance fees, and investing developers craving monetary profits from temple tourism. The rule and management of sacred temples are in the hands of investors who plan to put the temples to IPO (initial public offering), but some are stopped by the central government's decrees. As we now enter the third phase, the Chinese Buddhist community faces a challenge of cultivating a new generation of more talented monastics to fill the new, massive temples by promoting seminary education and facilitating more modern internet media and propagation of Buddhist dharma. \n\nThe ven. Dr. Yifa is abbess of Woodenfish Foundation (Beijing), a lawyer and a scholar of philosophy and religious studies. She is a leader in interreligious dialogue, Buddhist education and in advocacy for women's health and women's rights. Her work has been central to the development of Buddhist political, educational and charitable work in East Asia. \n\n~~~\nOver the course of 2016-17, the Robed Warriors program brings to the Five Colleges four prominent Buddhist monastic women whose work has transformed contemporary Buddhist practice and the world beyond.

Co-Sponsored by the Department of Politics   \n\nThe anthropocene is often defined as the era of human mastery over the earth, where humans have come to shape climate, geology, and time itself to terrifying and destructive effect. Yet one of the causes of the anthropocene's climate violence is the very idea of human mastery, or more precisely the belief that freedom equals human mastery over nature. The ideal of freedom as it has been understood in much Anglo-American politics -- freedom defined as sovereign individualism, as unbound agency, and as private ownership of nature -- is partly accountable for the geological violence that marks the anthropocene. Different visions of freedom might be crucial for reshaping political imaginaries toward slowing ecological destruction. By placing scientific research on gut microbiota and DNA in dialogue with political theories of agency, I offer different political imaginaries that repudiate individualism to envision free action not limited to the self-determining human that can master nature."},

In an era where the role of big money in politics has come under increased scrutiny and voters are concerned about potential corruption in the political system, there is increasing interest in the public financing of political campaigns. Reformers have argued that adoption of public financing systems, particularly voucher systems such as Seattle\u2019s innovative Democracy Vouchers program, can increase citizen participation in election financing, reduce the inequality among donors, reduce corruption, and attract a wider range of competitive candidates.\nIn the paper, Rolfe and her collaborators formally model the structural constraints present in all campaign finance systems, such as the fixed relationship between total campaign spending, average contribution size and total number of donors. They find that prior analysis may significantly overstate the ability of public funding programs such as those in Seattle to generate significant increases in the number of people who donate to political campaigns. Instead, structural limits on campaign spending and candidate participation may result in an overall decrease in the proportion of citizens donating to municipal elections. Their analysis highlights the inherent trade-offs in any campaign finance policy between the goals of increasing donor participation, limiting campaign spending, and reducing inequality among donors.\n\nSPP\u2019s colloquia are generally held monthly each semester and feature UMass faculty discussing ongoing research that has significant policy implications. The colloquium\u2019s theme this year is \u201cBroadening the SPP Network at UMass.\u201d\n\nAll talks in the SPP Faculty Colloquium are free and open to the public. Brownbag lunches are welcome.

Chicago)", "URL": "https://www.amherst.edu/academiclife/departments/music/events/node/670833", "Location": "Amhest College, Amhest, MA", "Time": "4:30 PM", "Date": "Mon, Mar 20, 2017", "Organization": "Amherst College", "Emily: \ud83d\udc4d": "", "Description": "The Music Department continues \u201cNew Perspectives in American Music,\u201d a four-part spring semester 2017 speaker series, with \"'Tuning Up' in Contemporary Gospel Performance\" a talk by Braxton D. Shelley (U. Chicago) at 4:30 p.m. on Monday, March 20, 2017, at the Center for Humanistic Inquiry, Frost Library, Amherst College.\n\nFor practitioners of many African American Christian traditions, \u201ctuning up\u201d is a colloquial referent for a preacher\u2019s shift from speech into song, most often at the end of a sermon. This phenomenon and its antecedents lie at the heart of many scholarly examinations of black preaching, ranging from Bruce Rosenburg\u2019s \"Can These Bones Live?: The Art of the American Folk Preacher\" (1970) to Frank Thomas\u2019 \"They Like to Never Quit Praisin\u2019 God: The Role of Celebration in Preaching.\" (1977) These observations concerning the musicality of black preaching depend on an analogy between such sermons and gospel songs. Although scholars have noted the interrelation of African American preaching and African American gospel music (Floyd 1997; Ramsey 2003), their relationship has not yet been used as a means to theorize gospel performance.\n\nBraxton extends \u201ctuning up\u201d from its specific role in black preaching to contemporary gospel performance, considering this practice as an analytic for formal procedure in gospel music. He begins by analyzing excerpts from sermons\u2014Bishop James Morton\u2019s \u201cThe Lazarus Conspiracy\", Rev. Dr. Gina Stewart\u2019s \u201cAm I My Brother and My Sister\u2019s Keeper\u201d and Rev. Dr. E. Dewey Smith\u2019s \u201cA Seminary From A Cemetery\u201d\u2014to illustrate the different forms this practice can take. He then uses homiletics, ritual theory, practice theory and phenomenology to argue that \u201ctuning up\u201d is a means of organizing attention. Close readings of three gospel songs\u2014Richard Smallwood\u2019s \u201cHealing,\u201d (1998) Myrna Summer\u2019s \u201cOh How Precious,\u201d (1975) and Brenda Moore\u2019s \u201cPerfect Praise\u201d (1989)\u2014to illustrate how the vamp, the repetitive ending cycle that is one of gospel\u2019s central features, musically performs the process of \u201ctuning up.\u201d As in the sermons, and in similar settings, the structure and performance of each of these songs invites an attention shift concomitant with the beginning of its vamp. It constitutes a shift in performance that calls forth a change in perception\u2014from the individual to the collective, and from the ear to the body, engendering a communal perception that lies at the heart of the gospel aesthetic.\n\nBraxton D. Shelley is a PhD candidate in the history and theory of music at the University of Chicago; he is also finishing a Master of Divinity in the University of Chicago\u2019s Divinity School. He earned a BA in music and history from Duke University. His dissertation, \"Sermons in Song: Richard Smallwood, the Vamp, and the Gospel Imagination\", develops an analytical paradigm for gospel music that braids together resources from cognitive theory, ritual theory and homiletics with studies of repetition, form, rhythm and meter. He has presented his research at Northwestern University\u2019s Music Theory and Cognition Workshop, Harvard University\u2019s Graduate Music Forum, Music Theory Midwest, and the Society for Christian Scholarship in Music."},

The concert is free and open to the public.\n\nOne of improvised music\u2019s most in-demand guitarists, Mary Halvorson has been active in New York since 2002, following jazz studies at Wesleyan University and the New School. Critics have called her \u201ca singular talent\u201d (Lloyd Sachs, JazzTimes), \u201cNYC\u2019s least-predictable improviser\u201d (Howard Mandel, City Arts), \u201cone of the most exciting and original guitarists in jazz\u2014or otherwise\u201d (Steve Dollar, Wall Street Journal), and \u201cone of today\u2019s most formidable bandleaders\u201d (Francis Davis, Village Voice). \n\nAfter three years of study with visionary composer and saxophonist Anthony Braxton, Halvorson became an active member of several of his bands, including his trio, septet and 12+1tet. To date, she has appeared on six of Braxton\u2019s recordings. Halvorson has also performed alongside iconic guitarist Marc Ribot, in his bands Sun Ship and The Young Philadelphians, and with the bassist Trevor Dunn in his Trio-Convulsant. Over the past decade she has worked with such diverse bandleaders as Tim Berne, Taylor Ho Bynum, Ingrid Laubrock, Myra Melford, Jason Moran, Joe Morris, Tom Rainey and Mike Reed.\n\nAs a bandleader and composer, one of Ms. Halvorson\u2019s primary outlet is her longstanding trio, featuring bassist John H\u00e9bert and drummer Ches Smith. Since their 2008 debut album, Dragon\u2019s Head, the band has been recognized as a rising star jazz band by Downbeat Magazine for five consecutive years. Ms. Halvorson\u2019s quintet, which adds trumpeter Jonathan Finlayson and alto saxophonist Jon Irabagon to the trio, has released two critically acclaimed albums on the Firehouse 12 label: Saturn Sings and Bending Bridges. Most recently she has added two additional band members\u2014tenor saxophonist Ingrid Laubrock and trombonist Jacob Garchik\u2014to form a septet, featured on her 2013 release, Illusionary Sea. Halvorson also co-leads a longstanding chamber-jazz duo with violist Jessica Pavone, the avant-rock band People and the collective ensembles Thumbscrew and Secret Keeper.\n\n\u201cIn the past few years, Mary Halvorson, already an acclaimed member of New York's Downtown improv scene, has been earning widespread recognition as a bandleader and composer of note,\u201d writes Troy Collins. \u201cHer writing displays an increasing sophistication with each new effort, revealing a compositional maturity as distinctive as her idiosyncratic guitar technique. Her latest ensemble, Reverse Blue, first performed at NYC's Blue Note as part of Search and Restore's \u2018Spontaneous Constructions\u2019 series. Despite their mixed pedigree, there is an aesthetic similarity amongst the tunes that lends a sense of stylistic cohesion to the proceedings. Cohesive, yet varied enough to signify its collaborative nature, Reverse Blue is another exceptional release from one of today's most adventurous artists.\u201d"},

But with its hooliganism, male chauvinism and hate rhetoric, this subculture also repulsed much of the Swedish mainstream, and prevented opponents of immigration from making appreciable political gains. Teitelbaum's talk explores activists' efforts to reject skinheadism and refashion themselves as upstanding agents of love and justice. He connects this reformist campaign with nationalists\u2019 emerging interest in showcasing traditional femininities in their expressive culture. His analysis centers on the works and reception of Swedish singer Saga\u2014currently the most popular musician in the greater white nationalist world. He shows how Saga and similar artists create gendered portrayals of white victimization in their music, portrayals that reinforce (male) nationalists\u2019 images of themselves as defenders of the oppressed. Teitelbaum's discussion offers insight into the shifting conceptual terrain of radical nationalism at a time when this movement is achieving unprecedented political gains throughout the Nordic region and Europe beyond."},

Their exclusive authority to produce and use atomic weapons\u2014codified by the Atomic Energy Act of 1946\u2014led to further expansions of presidential powers not conferred by the constitution.

We are students, activists, researchers, scholars, advocates, and justice-seekers. We come together. We vision. We share our successes and challenges. We hold each other accountable. We share our experiences. \n \nWith lifelong activists, newly inspired justice-seekers, veteran CLPP conference goers, and first-timers, the conference home that we are creating is approaching its 40th year. We celebrate our strength because we survive and share our resources so that we continue to thrive.  We come together to share power and build new skills. We come together to build the movement for reproductive freedom. We come home.\n \nOur communities are strong and resilient. The reproductive justice movement was birthed by women of color who said, We can\u2019t experience our power without abortion, without support for our families, without celebrating our choices to parent or not to parent, and without justice. At the annual CLPP conference, we join together to celebrate this strong legacy of justice-making and to build our movements.\n \nAt the conference, we strive to create a space where those at the frontlines of our struggles for justice are centered and our lived experiences are valued. Our vision is to create a home for the visible leadership of those most impacted by reproductive injustices: women of color, trans women, LGBTQ people, those who have been incarcerated, poor and working class people, youth, students, people with disabilities, immigrants, indigenous people, and others who are most acutely affected by reproductive, environmental, and social injustices. \n \nWe come together to listen and learn, to hold space to respond to the traumas inflicted upon our communities. We know that coming home is not always comfortable. We interrogate our discomfort. We expand our conversations about race and racism\u2014about white supremacy\u2014affirming that Black Lives Matter is central to achieving reproductive justice. \n \nWe know that coming home is hard work. At the CLPP conference, we center our desires for justice, and we hold back the tide. We vision for ourselves, our communities, our environments, and our society. \n \nWe celebrate the ways that we are creating the world that we want to live in. We tell our stories of abortions that we wanted, that we didn\u2019t want, that we had to fight for, and that we could not live without. We celebrate our creations\u2014our art, our stories, our families, our communities. We tell stories of the children and families we have had to fight to create. We celebrate through story, and we envision a world where each of us experiences power, pleasure, and autonomy.\n \nCome home to the CLPP conference to be inspired. Come to the conference to recalibrate for action. Come to celebrate the beauty and resilience of our movements. Reconnect with old friends, meet new strategic partners and mentors. Come create space with your communities and with new communities\u2014to build a vision centering diverse histories, identities, experiences and narratives. We don\u2019t all come to the CLPP conference as leaders, but we all take back new stories and skills to empower our communities.  \n \nWe hope you will share both your experiences and your desire to learn with us on April 7-9, 2017. Join us to find out how your work, your communities, and the issues you care about are part of the movement we are building for reproductive freedom."},

The gas-phase is mainly molecular and contains many exotic species, including radicals, unusual isomers, and anions, most of which are organic in nature. Although hydrogen is the dominant element and H2 the dominant gas-phase molecule, most organic molecules are very unsaturated and are labeled \u201ccarbon chains\u201d by astronomers. The dust particles are covered with ices, mainly in the form of water, CO, and CO2. During the collapse, the material evolves through a number of stages starting with an isothermal era, followed by a warm-up during which the gas-phase molecular inventory changes from a mainly exotic one to one in which most organic molecules resemble standard laboratory solvents, albeit in the gas phase. Eventually a so-called protoplanetary disk is formed around the young star, and the disk can lead to the formation of planets via coagulation of the dust particles, with an initial molecular inventory at least partially determined by the chemistry that has already occurred.\n\nMuch of what we know about the physical conditions and lifetimes of the various stages of star formation derives from molecules, which, through spectroscopy and kinetic modeling, are excellent probes of sources where they exist.1 In this talk, I will discuss the types of gas-phase and solid-state processes that synthesize molecules in assorted regions of star formation, with an emphasis on exotic gas-phase reactions and the chemistry that occurs in ice mantles."},
