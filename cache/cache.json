However, the precise nature of white fragility remains somewhat unclear\u2014what is it that all of these instances have in common? How is white fragility distinct from white privilege? And how is it connected to male fragility? In this essay, offer a unifying analysis of white fragility that clarifies its relationship to male fragility. I build on Robin DiAngelo (2011)\u2019s original articulation of the concept and Whitecomb, et al. (2015)\u2019s work on intellectual humility to argue that both fragilities are dispositions to epistemic arrogance with respect to the domains of racist and sexist oppression. Those with white and male fragility believe that they occupy a privileged epistemic position in these areas because they are white and/or male. In addition to establishing its status as an epistemic vice, I draw on Dotson (2011)\u2019s work on silencing, to show that fragility can be a form of epistemic violence. \n\nThe Gail Caldwell Stine Lecture is sponsored by the Department of Philosophy."},

His largely autodidactic trajectory, inspired by innate wanderlust, buttressed by philosophical conviction, enlivened by extraordinary linguistic abilities, and charged by urgent activist concern, cuts across the domains of politics, philosophy, history, and literature. He concerns himself with nothing less than the past, present, and future of India and the world. Buddhism and Marxism are the lode stars for this exploration. While his remarkable life tempts one to a reading of it as irreducibly unique, my attempt is to locate it within a larger intellectual and political milieu.\nMaya Joshi is Associate Professor in English at Lady Shri Ram College, University of Delhi. She is currently Fulbright Post-doctoral Fellow at the University of Pennsylvania, working towards an intellectual biography of Rahul Sankrityayan.

Liberalism has been employed to identify the dynamics within Islamic thought and distinguish between \u201cmoderate,\u201d \u201cconservative\u201d and \u201cextremist\u201d Islams. In this context, historians have engaged with \u201cIslam and liberalism\u201d, \u201cIslam in liberalism\u201d, and \u201cIslam after liberalism.\u201d But is there an Islam without liberalism?\nProf. Ghazal\u2019s talk examines a strand of religious thought during the \u201cliberal age\u201d that refused to accept the premises of liberalism, did not define Islam in relationship to it, and, more importantly, defended Islam against it. The proponents of this thought understood liberalism not only as championing social, cultural and religious values menacing to Islam and Muslims, but also as a political project aimed to destroy Islam. For them, liberalism embodied the battle between Christianity and Islam, and that between Europe and the Ottoman Empire. Therefore, they considered those Muslim modernists who promoted liberalism as traitors to Islam and facilitators of colonial projects. The Sufi scholar Yusuf al-Nabhani (1849\u20131932) best articulated these views. The lecture also addresses the polemics between al-Nabhani and Wahhabis who shared his disdain for liberalism. With the relative eclipse of Sufism in the Arab world in the 20th century and the eventual rise of Wahhabism, the battle to defend Islam against liberalism was largely left to the Wahhabis. The lecture concludes by suggesting that there is an intellectual genealogy linking al-Nabhani and his Wahhabi counterparts to a group like ISIS in its deliberate attempt to define and portray Islam as being opposed to values associated with liberalism.\nAmal Ghazal is Associate Professor of History & Director of the Center for Comparative Study of Muslim Societies and Cultures at Simon Fraser University. She is a known specialist on modern Islamic reform movements. "},

Participants will learn about EVs and plug-in hybrid EVs available, their features and range, big incentives that bring down their purchase price, charging an EV and matching the right EV and charger with your driving habits and needs. You\u2019ll also learn about pairing solar power for your home with the charging demands of your car, and when to charge for the lowest carbon impact."},

She says simply, \u201cPoetry is telling something to someone.\u201d In the words of Stanley Kunitz, Howe\u2019s \u201ctelling\u201d is \u201cluminous, intense, and eloquent, rooted in an abundant inner life.\u201d Her work glows with light and lightness that bear heavy questions of existence. Alicia Ostriker considers her \u201camong our most gifted poets of trauma and healing.\u201d Part of the urgency and importance of Howe\u2019s poetry stems from its rootedness in real life. Her latest book, Magdalene, transforms driving, watching television and cleaning kitchen counters into prayer and meditation on mortality. As Mary Magdalene becomes every woman, our contemporary anguish is set on surprisingly common ground with divine and metaphysical preoccupations. As Nick Flynn puts it, Howe \u201chas always come as close as any poet since Rilke to touching eternity, simply by stretching out her hand and believing that something exists beyond her grasp, beyond her knowing.\u201d Her bravery in laying bare the music of her own pain is part of its resonance. Howe served as the New York Poet Laureate from 2012-2014, and is the recipient of many distinguished awards, including fellowships from the Bunting Institute at Radcliffe College, the Academy of American Poets, and the Guggenheim Foundation. She teaches creative writing at Sarah Lawrence College and New York University.\nHowe will read with the Winner and Finalists in the Twelfth Annual High School Prize."},

A century later, Machu Picchu is a UNESCO world heritage site visited by more than a million tourists annually. This remarkable transformation began with the photographs that accompanied Bingham\u2019s article published in National Geographicmagazine, which depicted Machu Picchu as a lost city discovered. Focusing on the practices, technologies, and materializations of Bingham\u2019s three expeditions to Peru (1911, 1912, 1914\u20131915), this book makes a convincing case that visualization, particularly through the camera, played a decisive role in positioning Machu Picchu as both a scientific discovery and a Peruvian heritage site.\n\n6:00-8:00pm, FCWSRC, 83 College Street, Mount Holyoke College, South Hadley"},

Police officers threw out first pitches, returning veterans were honored at half-time. Sports events began to seem like advertisements for the military and law enforcement.  In the wake of the shootings of black men, the acquittal of white police officers who shot them, and the resurgence of white supremacy groups, black athletes like LeBron James and and Carmelo Anthony are reviving a tradition of activism that reaches back to Jackie Robinson and Mohammed Ali.
