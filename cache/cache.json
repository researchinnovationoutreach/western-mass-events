The secrecy and concentrated power under which the first atomic weapons were created provided a model for the post\u2013World War II permanent national security state, presided over by presidents invested with unprecedented power. Their exclusive authority to produce and use atomic weapons\u2014codified by the Atomic Energy Act of 1946\u2014led to further expansions of presidential powers not conferred by the constitution. The authority to launch globe-threatening weapons has led to a wide range of additional assertions of power unaccountable to the public or its elected representatives, including covert overthrows of foreign governments, secret bombing of foreign nations, unilateral abdication of treaties, warrantless surveillance of American citizens, and routine circumvention of Congress\u2019s constitutional power to declare war.\n\nThis lecture will argue that nuclear weapons are inherently undemocratic and must be abolished before we can begin dismantling the national security state and restoring genuinely representative government.\nProfessor Appy will be presented with the Chancellor\u2019s Medal, the highest recognition bestowed to faculty by the campus, at the conclusion of the lecture.\n\nThis lecture is free and open to the public.

We are students, activists, researchers, scholars, advocates, and justice-seekers. We come together. We vision. We share our successes and challenges. We hold each other accountable. We share our experiences. \n \nWith lifelong activists, newly inspired justice-seekers, veteran CLPP conference goers, and first-timers, the conference home that we are creating is approaching its 40th year. We celebrate our strength because we survive and share our resources so that we continue to thrive.  We come together to share power and build new skills. We come together to build the movement for reproductive freedom. We come home.\n \nOur communities are strong and resilient. The reproductive justice movement was birthed by women of color who said, We can\u2019t experience our power without abortion, without support for our families, without celebrating our choices to parent or not to parent, and without justice. At the annual CLPP conference, we join together to celebrate this strong legacy of justice-making and to build our movements.\n \nAt the conference, we strive to create a space where those at the frontlines of our struggles for justice are centered and our lived experiences are valued. Our vision is to create a home for the visible leadership of those most impacted by reproductive injustices: women of color, trans women, LGBTQ people, those who have been incarcerated, poor and working class people, youth, students, people with disabilities, immigrants, indigenous people, and others who are most acutely affected by reproductive, environmental, and social injustices. \n \nWe come together to listen and learn, to hold space to respond to the traumas inflicted upon our communities. We know that coming home is not always comfortable. We interrogate our discomfort. We expand our conversations about race and racism\u2014about white supremacy\u2014affirming that Black Lives Matter is central to achieving reproductive justice. \n \nWe know that coming home is hard work. At the CLPP conference, we center our desires for justice, and we hold back the tide. We vision for ourselves, our communities, our environments, and our society. \n \nWe celebrate the ways that we are creating the world that we want to live in. We tell our stories of abortions that we wanted, that we didn\u2019t want, that we had to fight for, and that we could not live without. We celebrate our creations\u2014our art, our stories, our families, our communities. We tell stories of the children and families we have had to fight to create. We celebrate through story, and we envision a world where each of us experiences power, pleasure, and autonomy.\n \nCome home to the CLPP conference to be inspired. Come to the conference to recalibrate for action. Come to celebrate the beauty and resilience of our movements. Reconnect with old friends, meet new strategic partners and mentors. Come create space with your communities and with new communities\u2014to build a vision centering diverse histories, identities, experiences and narratives. We don\u2019t all come to the CLPP conference as leaders, but we all take back new stories and skills to empower our communities.  \n \nWe hope you will share both your experiences and your desire to learn with us on April 7-9, 2017. Join us to find out how your work, your communities, and the issues you care about are part of the movement we are building for reproductive freedom."},

The gas-phase is mainly molecular and contains many exotic species, including radicals, unusual isomers, and anions, most of which are organic in nature. Although hydrogen is the dominant element and H2 the dominant gas-phase molecule, most organic molecules are very unsaturated and are labeled \u201ccarbon chains\u201d by astronomers. The dust particles are covered with ices, mainly in the form of water, CO, and CO2. During the collapse, the material evolves through a number of stages starting with an isothermal era, followed by a warm-up during which the gas-phase molecular inventory changes from a mainly exotic one to one in which most organic molecules resemble standard laboratory solvents, albeit in the gas phase. Eventually a so-called protoplanetary disk is formed around the young star, and the disk can lead to the formation of planets via coagulation of the dust particles, with an initial molecular inventory at least partially determined by the chemistry that has already occurred.\n\nMuch of what we know about the physical conditions and lifetimes of the various stages of star formation derives from molecules, which, through spectroscopy and kinetic modeling, are excellent probes of sources where they exist.1 In this talk, I will discuss the types of gas-phase and solid-state processes that synthesize molecules in assorted regions of star formation, with an emphasis on exotic gas-phase reactions and the chemistry that occurs in ice mantles."},

Routinely excluded from institutions of scientific learning and training, they transformed cultural spaces like the page, the stage, the parlor, and even the pulpit into laboratories of knowledge and experimentation. From the recovery of neglected figures like Robert Benjamin Lewis, Hosea Easton, and Sarah Mapps Douglass, to new accounts of Martin Delany, Henry Box Brown, and Frederick Douglass, Fugitive Science makes natural science central to how we understand the origins and development of African American literature and culture. \n\nThis distinct and pioneering book will spark interest from anyone wishing to learn more on race and society."},
