In this talk, we describe the design and analysis of the SEARCH trial, an ongoing community randomized trial to evaluate the impact of early HIV diagnosis and immediate treatment with streamlined care in rural Uganda and Kenya. We focus on 3 choices to optimize the design and analysis. These choices are compared theoretically and with finite sample simulations. We demonstrate how each choice improves efficiency relative to standard practice, while maintaining nominal confidence interval coverage. We conclude with practical implications and some ongoing challenges."},

Between 1969 and 1989, Science for the People mobilized American scientists, teachers, and students to practice a socially and economically just science, rather than one that served militarism and corporate profits. Through research, writing, protest, and organizing, members sought to demystify scientific knowledge and embolden \"the people\" to take science and technology into their own hands. The movement\u2019s numerous publications were crucial to the formation of science and technology studies, challenging mainstream understandings of science as \"neutral\" and instead showing it as inherently political. Its members, some at prominent universities, became models for politically engaged science and scholarship by using their knowledge to challenge, rather than uphold, the social, political, and economic status quo.\nHighlighting Science for the People\u2019s activism and intellectual interventions in a range of areas\u2014including militarism, race, gender, medicine, agriculture, energy, and global affairs\u2014this volume offers vital contributions to today\u2019s debates on science, justice, democracy, sustainability, and political power."},

The movement\u2019s victories were inspirational, but its failures to bring about structural political and economic change pushed many to look elsewhere for new strategies. During this era of intellectual ferment, the writers, editors, and activists behind the monthly magazine Liberator (1960\u201371) were essential contributors to the debate. In the first full-length history of the organization that produced the magazine, Christopher M. Tinson locates the Liberator as a touchstone of U.S.-based black radical thought and organizing in the 1960s. Combining radical journalism with on-the-ground activism, the magazine was dedicated to the dissemination of a range of cultural criticism aimed at spurring political activism and became the publishing home to many notable radical intellectual-activists of the period, such as Larry Neal, Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee, Harold Cruse, and Askia Tour\u00e9.\n \nBy mapping the history and intellectual trajectory of the Liberator and its thinkers, Tinson traces black intellectual history beyond black power and black nationalism into an internationalism that would shape radical thought for decades to come.Christopher M. Tinson, Ph.D., is currently an associate professor of Africana Studies and History at Hampshire College.  His research and teaching is interdisciplinary and focuses on Africana radical traditions, U.S. ethnic studies, critical media studies, incarceration, and race and sports. His writings and reviews have been published in The Black Scholar, The Feminist Wire, Radical Teacher, Equity & Excellence in Education, and Counterpunch. His first book, entitled Radical Intellect: Liberator Magazine and Black Activism in the 1960s, is published by UNC Press. Professor Tinson is a highly sought-after speaker and mentor who has led professional development workshops and lectured at numerous college campuses, high schools, and carceral institutions throughout New England and the Tri-State area.

She situates Native identity among theories of diaspora, cosmopolitanism, and transnationalism by examining urban narratives\u2014such as those written by Sherman Alexie, Janet Campbell Hale, Louise Erdrich, and Susan Power\u2014along with the work of filmmakers and artists. In these stories Native peoples navigate new surroundings, find and reformulate community, and maintain and redefine Indian identity in the postrelocation era. These narratives illuminate the changing relationship between urban Indigenous peoples and their tribal nations and territories and the ways in which new cosmopolitan bonds both reshape and are interpreted by tribal identities.\n\nDiscussants: Christine DeLucia (Assistant Professor of History, Mount Holyoke College), Laura Doyle (Professor of English, UMass Amherst), Laura Fugikawa (Visiting Assistant Professor in the Study of Women and Gender and English Language and Literatures, Smith College), and Kiara Vigil (Assistant Professor of American Studies, Amherst College)"},

A century later, Machu Picchu is a UNESCO world heritage site visited by more than a million tourists annually. This remarkable transformation began with the photographs that accompanied Bingham\u2019s article published in National Geographicmagazine, which depicted Machu Picchu as a lost city discovered. Focusing on the practices, technologies, and materializations of Bingham\u2019s three expeditions to Peru (1911, 1912, 1914\u20131915), this book makes a convincing case that visualization, particularly through the camera, played a decisive role in positioning Machu Picchu as both a scientific discovery and a Peruvian heritage site.\n\n6:00-8:00pm, FCWSRC, 83 College Street, Mount Holyoke College, South Hadley"},
