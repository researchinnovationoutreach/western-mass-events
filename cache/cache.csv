However, the physics of granular media present significant complexities that are still poorly understood. Impact of granular targets by solid projectiles is an experimental approach to understanding force transmission in soft matter. A granular target can cause a free-falling projectile to come to an abrupt stop as its momentum is dissipated to the grains. A complete interpretation of the stopping force, incorporating grain-scale interactions during impact, remains unresolved. We use direct force measurements and high-speed imaging to determine the forces acting on a projectile as it decelerates through a dense granular medium. These impact studies probe the unique response and properties of granular media.",https://www.amherst.edu/academiclife/departments/physics/seminars_and_colloquia/node/652287,

In this talk, Ching will explain Xiao's work and describe some problems in this area that are still unsolved.

Professor Ching writes that ""to make an Apollonian Circle Packing you start with three mutually tangent circles in a plane and add those new circles that are tangent to all three. Then you add new circles tangent to three you already have and repeat forever. The resulting collection of circles forms a beautiful fractal-like picture. But what sorts of pictures are possible? How much of the plane gets covered by the resulting circles? And how do the answers depend on which three circles you started with? Sunny discovered new circle packings with extra symmetry that increased our understanding of these issues, but there is still a lot to be worked out.""",https://www.amherst.edu/news/calendar/node/675784,

Buddhism in Current China - lecture by The Venerable Yifa,"Religion, History, Humanities","Hampshire College, Smith College, Amherst College","Wed, Mar 1, 2017",,5:00pm-7:00pm,"Hampshire College, Amherst, MA","As the founder of the Woodenfish Project in 2002 which moved from Taiwan to mainland China in 2009, the Ven. Yifa has been a first-hand witness of many changes and revivals within the Buddhist community in China. In her lecture, the Ven. Yifa will share her reflections on the phenomena of Buddhist rejuvenation in current China. During the first phase in the 1980's after China's Cultural Revolution, Buddhist leaders derived policies to revive Buddhism. During the second phase, after the thirty years of Deng Xiaoping's economic reforms, reconstruction of giant temples and monasteries on historical sites mushroomed around the country. Under the surface of massive temple reconstruction, we find struggles sparking between the monastic communities that want to uphold cultural traditions, local governments seeking revenue from entrance fees, and investing developers craving monetary profits from temple tourism. The rule and management of sacred temples are in the hands of investors who plan to put the temples to IPO (initial public offering), but some are stopped by the central government's decrees. As we now enter the third phase, the Chinese Buddhist community faces a challenge of cultivating a new generation of more talented monastics to fill the new, massive temples by promoting seminary education and facilitating more modern internet media and propagation of Buddhist dharma. 

The ven. Dr. Yifa is abbess of Woodenfish Foundation (Beijing), a lawyer and a scholar of philosophy and religious studies. She is a leader in interreligious dialogue, Buddhist education and in advocacy for women's health and women's rights. Her work has been central to the development of Buddhist political, educational and charitable work in East Asia.

In this lecture, Ticktin is concerned by the ways in which border walls and zones come not simply to defend (i.e. certain territories), but to define  -- that is, to shape or alter categories of natural and human kinds. She will suggest that borders walls, and all the surrounding and auxiliary technologies they harness, work by shifting how we understand different kinds of beings, ultimately rendering certain kinds killable.

The anthropocene is often defined as the era of human mastery over the earth, where humans have come to shape climate, geology, and time itself to terrifying and destructive effect. Yet one of the causes of the anthropocene's climate violence is the very idea of human mastery, or more precisely the belief that freedom equals human mastery over nature. The ideal of freedom as it has been understood in much Anglo-American politics -- freedom defined as sovereign individualism, as unbound agency, and as private ownership of nature -- is partly accountable for the geological violence that marks the anthropocene. Different visions of freedom might be crucial for reshaping political imaginaries toward slowing ecological destruction. By placing scientific research on gut microbiota and DNA in dialogue with political theories of agency, I offer different political imaginaries that repudiate individualism to envision free action not limited to the self-determining human that can master nature.",https://events.mtholyoke.edu/MasterCalendar/EventDetails.aspx?EventDetailId=42904,

The Social Life of Guns: The Symbolic and Material Construction of Guns Conference,"History, English, Humanities, Arts, Global Studies, Diversity/Equity/Inclusion",Amherst College,"Fri, Mar 3, 2017","Sat, Mar 4, 2017",,"Amherst College and Lord Jeffrey Inn, Amherst, MA","This year‚Äôs  Copeland Colloquium is ‚ÄúThe Social Life of Guns.‚Äù The Colloquium will explore how and why do guns become objects of social identity?  What is the importance of these objects in defining the meaning of citizenship? Should the problem of gun violence be thought about as an epidemiological issue or as a matter of criminal justice? Explorations of these questions might take myriad forms. It will look at the literary and symbolic life of guns and those who study guns as objects of cultural practice and ritual across the world.  It will also seek to investigate the importance of guns in changing social and political conditions, including-for example-in colonial expansion by European powers, in the militarization of ‚Äúthe police,‚Äù or in racially charged violence in U.S. cities. 

The conference will feature presentations from a number of distinguished experts including Elisabeth Anker (George Washington University), Harel Shapira (University of Texas), Timothy Luke (Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University), Joanna Bourke (University of London), Franklin Zimring (University of California, Berkeley) and David Yamane (Wake Forest University). The conference is sponsored by the 2016-17 Copeland Colloquium, as part of a series of events organized to explore the symbolic and culture construction of guns and to ask questions about the symbolic value of guns and the meanings the weapons used in the making of day-to-day violence convey.

Trade-offs in Campaign Finance Reform: Less Money or More Donors,"History, Humanities",Umass Amherst School of Public Policy,"Mon, Mar 6, 2017",,12:15-1:15pm,"Umass Amherst, Amherst, MA","The School of Public Policy (SPP) will kick off its Spring 2017 Faculty Colloquium series with a talk by Meredith Rolfe, associate professor of political science.

Rolfe‚Äôs talk, ‚ÄúTrade-offs in Campaign Finance Reform: Less Money or More Donors,‚Äù will draw on her recent paper about that topic. In an era where the role of big money in politics has come under increased scrutiny and voters are concerned about potential corruption in the political system, there is increasing interest in the public financing of political campaigns. Reformers have argued that adoption of public financing systems, particularly voucher systems such as Seattle‚Äôs innovative Democracy Vouchers program, can increase citizen participation in election financing, reduce the inequality among donors, reduce corruption, and attract a wider range of competitive candidates.
In the paper, Rolfe and her collaborators formally model the structural constraints present in all campaign finance systems, such as the fixed relationship between total campaign spending, average contribution size and total number of donors. They find that prior analysis may significantly overstate the ability of public funding programs such as those in Seattle to generate significant increases in the number of people who donate to political campaigns. Instead, structural limits on campaign spending and candidate participation may result in an overall decrease in the proportion of citizens donating to municipal elections. Their analysis highlights the inherent trade-offs in any campaign finance policy between the goals of increasing donor participation, limiting campaign spending, and reducing inequality among donors.

SPP‚Äôs colloquia are generally held monthly each semester and feature UMass faculty discussing ongoing research that has significant policy implications. The colloquium‚Äôs theme this year is ‚ÄúBroadening the SPP Network at UMass.‚Äù

Social Science Matters: 'Sanctuary and Undocumented Students',"History, Humanities, Diversity/Equity/Inclusion, Women's Studies, Global Studies",Five College Women's Studies Research Center and UMass Amherst,"Tue, Mar 7, 2017",,4:00-6:00pm,"Umass Amherst, Amherst, MA","Karma Ch√°vez, associate professor and director of graduate studies, department of Mexican American & Latina/o Studies, University of Texas-Austin, will present on her research.

Upon the election of Trump as President of the US, undocumented immigrant students and their allies scrambled to strategize mechanisms of support for those who feared losing their protected status under Obama's 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) executive order. Given that Trump has explicitly said he will repeal DACA and take an aggressive and enforcement-only approach to immigration more broadly, the already precarious situation for all immigrants living in the US seemed all the more dire. University committees, student groups, and academic organizations began strategizing about what it would mean to make universities ""sanctuaries"" for undocumented students. Several hundred university presidents signed on to a letter in Dec. 2016 declaring their support for undocumented students, though the terms of that support was unspecified. This paper considers the various dimensions of the question of the university as a sanctuary space as posed in popular discourse, what it might mean for the university to actually be safe, or at least safer for its most marginalized residents, and how these questions might open new space to think about ways revise, recreate and promote the mission of the public university amid conservative backlash, austerity, and privatization.

Ch√°vez's scholarship is primarily informed by queer of color theory and women of color feminism. Methodologically, she is a rhetorical critic who variously utilizes textual and field based methods. She is interested in studying social movement building, activist rhetoric, and coalitional politics. Her work emphasizes the rhetorical practices of groups marginalized within existing power structures, but she also attends to rhetoric produced by powerful institutions and actors about marginalized folks and the systems that oppress them (e.g., immigration system, prisons etc.).

‚ÄúTuning Up‚Äù in Contemporary Gospel Performance by Braxton D. Shelley (U. Chicago),"Religion, Humanities, Music",Amherst College,"Mon, Mar 20, 2017",,4:30 PM,"Amhest College, Amhest, MA","The Music Department continues ‚ÄúNew Perspectives in American Music,‚Äù a four-part spring semester 2017 speaker series, with ""'Tuning Up' in Contemporary Gospel Performance"" a talk by Braxton D. Shelley (U. Chicago) at 4:30 p.m. on Monday, March 20, 2017, at the Center for Humanistic Inquiry, Frost Library, Amherst College.

For practitioners of many African American Christian traditions, ‚Äútuning up‚Äù is a colloquial referent for a preacher‚Äôs shift from speech into song, most often at the end of a sermon. This phenomenon and its antecedents lie at the heart of many scholarly examinations of black preaching, ranging from Bruce Rosenburg‚Äôs ""Can These Bones Live?: The Art of the American Folk Preacher"" (1970) to Frank Thomas‚Äô ""They Like to Never Quit Praisin‚Äô God: The Role of Celebration in Preaching."" (1977) These observations concerning the musicality of black preaching depend on an analogy between such sermons and gospel songs. Although scholars have noted the interrelation of African American preaching and African American gospel music (Floyd 1997; Ramsey 2003), their relationship has not yet been used as a means to theorize gospel performance.

Braxton extends ‚Äútuning up‚Äù from its specific role in black preaching to contemporary gospel performance, considering this practice as an analytic for formal procedure in gospel music. He begins by analyzing excerpts from sermons‚ÄîBishop James Morton‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Lazarus Conspiracy"", Rev. Dr. Gina Stewart‚Äôs ‚ÄúAm I My Brother and My Sister‚Äôs Keeper‚Äù and Rev. Dr. E. Dewey Smith‚Äôs ‚ÄúA Seminary From A Cemetery‚Äù‚Äîto illustrate the different forms this practice can take. He then uses homiletics, ritual theory, practice theory and phenomenology to argue that ‚Äútuning up‚Äù is a means of organizing attention. Close readings of three gospel songs‚ÄîRichard Smallwood‚Äôs ‚ÄúHealing,‚Äù (1998) Myrna Summer‚Äôs ‚ÄúOh How Precious,‚Äù (1975) and Brenda Moore‚Äôs ‚ÄúPerfect Praise‚Äù (1989)‚Äîto illustrate how the vamp, the repetitive ending cycle that is one of gospel‚Äôs central features, musically performs the process of ‚Äútuning up.‚Äù As in the sermons, and in similar settings, the structure and performance of each of these songs invites an attention shift concomitant with the beginning of its vamp. It constitutes a shift in performance that calls forth a change in perception‚Äîfrom the individual to the collective, and from the ear to the body, engendering a communal perception that lies at the heart of the gospel aesthetic.

Braxton D. Shelley is a PhD candidate in the history and theory of music at the University of Chicago; he is also finishing a Master of Divinity in the University of Chicago‚Äôs Divinity School. He earned a BA in music and history from Duke University. His dissertation, ""Sermons in Song: Richard Smallwood, the Vamp, and the Gospel Imagination"", develops an analytical paradigm for gospel music that braids together resources from cognitive theory, ritual theory and homiletics with studies of repetition, form, rhythm and meter. He has presented his research at Northwestern University‚Äôs Music Theory and Cognition Workshop, Harvard University‚Äôs Graduate Music Forum, Music Theory Midwest, and the Society for Christian Scholarship in Music.",https://www.amherst.edu/academiclife/departments/music/events/node/670833,

Far From Sanctuary: African American Travel and the Road to Civil Rights,"History, Humanities, Diversity/Equity/Inclusion",Umass Amherst,"Tue, Mar 21, 2017",,4:00 PM,"Umass Amherst, Amherst, MA","2017 Writer-in-Residence: Allyson Hobbs presents ""Far From Sanctuary: African American Travel and the Road to Civil Rights.""

This talk argues that the national fraternity of American motorists excluded African Americans during the early to mid-twentieth century despite the ostensibly democratic nature of the ‚Äúopen road.‚Äù Providing a textured account of the emotional lives of black drivers including the sense of pride, the seduction, and the exhilaration that owning a car offered, this talk also considers the fears and anxieties that arose once African Americans motorists got behind the wheel. The road was (and certainly, still is) a site of racial contestation. This talk calls for a reconsideration of ‚Äúautomobility‚Äù and the role of the car in African American culture. 

Allyson Hobbs is an associate professor in the department of distory and Director of African and African American Studies at Stanford University.  She is a contributing staff writer for the New Yorker.com and a Distinguished Lecturer for the Organization of American Historians. Allyson‚Äôs first book, A Chosen Exile: A History of Racial Passing in American Life, published by Harvard University Press in 2014, examines the phenomenon of racial passing in the United States from the late eighteenth century to the present.  A Chosen Exile won the Frederick Jackson Turner Prize for best first book in American history and the Lawrence Levine Prize for best book in American cultural history.",http://www.umass.edu/events/lecture-presenting-2017-writer,

Concert: Magic Triangle Jazz Series presents: Mary Halvorson's Reverse Blue,"Arts, Music",Umass Amherst,"Mon, Mar 27, 2017",,8:00 PM,"Umass Amherst, Amherst, MA","Free admission.

The Magic Triangle Jazz Series, produced by the Fine Arts Center at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, in collaboration with the Smith College Department of Music, continues its 28th season with a performance by Mary Halvorson‚Äôs Reverse Blue, featuring Mary Halvorson, guitar, Chris Speed, saxophone, clarinet, Eivind Opsvik, bass and Tomas Fujiwara, drums. The concert is free and open to the public.

One of improvised music‚Äôs most in-demand guitarists, Mary Halvorson has been active in New York since 2002, following jazz studies at Wesleyan University and the New School. Critics have called her ‚Äúa singular talent‚Äù (Lloyd Sachs, JazzTimes), ‚ÄúNYC‚Äôs least-predictable improviser‚Äù (Howard Mandel, City Arts), ‚Äúone of the most exciting and original guitarists in jazz‚Äîor otherwise‚Äù (Steve Dollar, Wall Street Journal), and ‚Äúone of today‚Äôs most formidable bandleaders‚Äù (Francis Davis, Village Voice). 

After three years of study with visionary composer and saxophonist Anthony Braxton, Halvorson became an active member of several of his bands, including his trio, septet and 12+1tet. To date, she has appeared on six of Braxton‚Äôs recordings. Halvorson has also performed alongside iconic guitarist Marc Ribot, in his bands Sun Ship and The Young Philadelphians, and with the bassist Trevor Dunn in his Trio-Convulsant. Over the past decade she has worked with such diverse bandleaders as Tim Berne, Taylor Ho Bynum, Ingrid Laubrock, Myra Melford, Jason Moran, Joe Morris, Tom Rainey and Mike Reed.

As a bandleader and composer, one of Ms. Halvorson‚Äôs primary outlet is her longstanding trio, featuring bassist John H√©bert and drummer Ches Smith. Since their 2008 debut album, Dragon‚Äôs Head, the band has been recognized as a rising star jazz band by Downbeat Magazine for five consecutive years. Ms. Halvorson‚Äôs quintet, which adds trumpeter Jonathan Finlayson and alto saxophonist Jon Irabagon to the trio, has released two critically acclaimed albums on the Firehouse 12 label: Saturn Sings and Bending Bridges. Most recently she has added two additional band members‚Äîtenor saxophonist Ingrid Laubrock and trombonist Jacob Garchik‚Äîto form a septet, featured on her 2013 release, Illusionary Sea. Halvorson also co-leads a longstanding chamber-jazz duo with violist Jessica Pavone, the avant-rock band People and the collective ensembles Thumbscrew and Secret Keeper.

‚ÄúIn the past few years, Mary Halvorson, already an acclaimed member of New York's Downtown improv scene, has been earning widespread recognition as a bandleader and composer of note,‚Äù writes Troy Collins. ‚ÄúHer writing displays an increasing sophistication with each new effort, revealing a compositional maturity as distinctive as her idiosyncratic guitar technique. Her latest ensemble, Reverse Blue, first performed at NYC's Blue Note as part of Search and Restore's ‚ÄòSpontaneous Constructions‚Äô series. Despite their mixed pedigree, there is an aesthetic similarity amongst the tunes that lends a sense of stylistic cohesion to the proceedings. Cohesive, yet varied enough to signify its collaborative nature, Reverse Blue is another exceptional release from one of today's most adventurous artists.‚Äù",http://www.umass.edu/events/concert-magic-triangle-jazz-0,

Prof. at the University of Colorado, Boulder

White supremacists, ethnic separatists and cultural ultraconservatives populate Sweden‚Äôs scene of self-identified nationalists. Despite pronounced ideological and social differences among nationalists, most can trace their activism to a cultural movement that engulfed Western Europe during the 1990s: skinheadism.

Skinhead style and white power music provided vital fundraising and recruiting channels for radical nationalists in Sweden. But with its hooliganism, male chauvinism and hate rhetoric, this subculture also repulsed much of the Swedish mainstream, and prevented opponents of immigration from making appreciable political gains. Teitelbaum's talk explores activists' efforts to reject skinheadism and refashion themselves as upstanding agents of love and justice. He connects this reformist campaign with nationalists‚Äô emerging interest in showcasing traditional femininities in their expressive culture. His analysis centers on the works and reception of Swedish singer Saga‚Äîcurrently the most popular musician in the greater white nationalist world. He shows how Saga and similar artists create gendered portrayals of white victimization in their music, portrayals that reinforce (male) nationalists‚Äô images of themselves as defenders of the oppressed. Teitelbaum's discussion offers insight into the shifting conceptual terrain of radical nationalism at a time when this movement is achieving unprecedented political gains throughout the Nordic region and Europe beyond.",https://www.amherst.edu/academiclife/departments/music/events/node/675816,

Distinguished Faculty Lecture: Christian Appy,"History, Humanities, Global Studies",Umass Amherst,"Tue, Apr 4, 2017",,8:00 PM,"Umass Amherst, Amherst, MA","From the Manhattan Project to the Global War on Terror, nuclear weapons have had a pernicious impact on American political culture. The secrecy and concentrated power under which the first atomic weapons were created provided a model for the post‚ÄìWorld War II permanent national security state, presided over by presidents invested with unprecedented power. Their exclusive authority to produce and use atomic weapons‚Äîcodified by the Atomic Energy Act of 1946‚Äîled to further expansions of presidential powers not conferred by the constitution. The authority to launch globe-threatening weapons has led to a wide range of additional assertions of power unaccountable to the public or its elected representatives, including covert overthrows of foreign governments, secret bombing of foreign nations, unilateral abdication of treaties, warrantless surveillance of American citizens, and routine circumvention of Congress‚Äôs constitutional power to declare war.

This lecture will argue that nuclear weapons are inherently undemocratic and must be abolished before we can begin dismantling the national security state and restoring genuinely representative government.
Professor Appy will be presented with the Chancellor‚Äôs Medal, the highest recognition bestowed to faculty by the campus, at the conclusion of the lecture.

Indigenous languages emphasize the animacy of the land, and all the living beings who rely upon the land‚Äôs sustenance for survival.

As Robin Kimmerer notes, we have much to gain from intertwining and comparing the long, ongoing intellectual tradition of Indigenous knowledge, embedded in language and written on the land, with scientific knowledge.

As ‚Äúa cumulative body of knowledge, practice, and belief‚Äù (Berkes 1999) developed by Indigenous communities over thousands of years, TEK provides a core source for understanding ecological patterns and processes as well as ecosystem structure and function, and for developing innovative approaches to conservation, remediation and restoration in local places and global networks.",https://www.fivecolleges.edu/calendar-of-events/listings/node/161363,

From Abortion Rights to Social Justice: Building the Movement for Reproductive Freedom,"Humanities, History, Global Studies, Diversity/Equity/Inclusion, Women's Studies",Civil Liberties and Public Policy (CLPP) and Hampshire College,"Fri, Apr 7, 2017","Sun, Apr 9, 2017",All day,"Hampshire College, Amherst, MA","From Abortion Rights to Social Justice: Building the Movement for Reproductive Freedom is the conference where CLPP invites people who are completely new to reproductive and social justice to learn alongside those who have shaped, shaken up, and laid new ground for our movements for years. We are students, activists, researchers, scholars, advocates, and justice-seekers. We come together. We vision. We share our successes and challenges. We hold each other accountable. We share our experiences. 
 
With lifelong activists, newly inspired justice-seekers, veteran CLPP conference goers, and first-timers, the conference home that we are creating is approaching its 40th year. We celebrate our strength because we survive and share our resources so that we continue to thrive.  We come together to share power and build new skills. We come together to build the movement for reproductive freedom. We come home.
 
Our communities are strong and resilient. The reproductive justice movement was birthed by women of color who said, We can‚Äôt experience our power without abortion, without support for our families, without celebrating our choices to parent or not to parent, and without justice. At the annual CLPP conference, we join together to celebrate this strong legacy of justice-making and to build our movements.
 
At the conference, we strive to create a space where those at the frontlines of our struggles for justice are centered and our lived experiences are valued. Our vision is to create a home for the visible leadership of those most impacted by reproductive injustices: women of color, trans women, LGBTQ people, those who have been incarcerated, poor and working class people, youth, students, people with disabilities, immigrants, indigenous people, and others who are most acutely affected by reproductive, environmental, and social injustices. 
 
We come together to listen and learn, to hold space to respond to the traumas inflicted upon our communities. We know that coming home is not always comfortable. We interrogate our discomfort. We expand our conversations about race and racism‚Äîabout white supremacy‚Äîaffirming that Black Lives Matter is central to achieving reproductive justice. 
 
We know that coming home is hard work. At the CLPP conference, we center our desires for justice, and we hold back the tide. We vision for ourselves, our communities, our environments, and our society. 
 
We celebrate the ways that we are creating the world that we want to live in. We tell our stories of abortions that we wanted, that we didn‚Äôt want, that we had to fight for, and that we could not live without. We celebrate our creations‚Äîour art, our stories, our families, our communities. We tell stories of the children and families we have had to fight to create. We celebrate through story, and we envision a world where each of us experiences power, pleasure, and autonomy.
 
Come home to the CLPP conference to be inspired. Come to the conference to recalibrate for action. Come to celebrate the beauty and resilience of our movements. Reconnect with old friends, meet new strategic partners and mentors. Come create space with your communities and with new communities‚Äîto build a vision centering diverse histories, identities, experiences and narratives. We don‚Äôt all come to the CLPP conference as leaders, but we all take back new stories and skills to empower our communities.  
 
We hope you will share both your experiences and your desire to learn with us on April 7-9, 2017. Join us to find out how your work, your communities, and the issues you care about are part of the movement we are building for reproductive freedom.",https://clpp.hampshire.edu/conference/2017-conference,
