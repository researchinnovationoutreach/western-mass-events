Poorly tested and over-promoted to doctors, DES was distributed to millions of women. They were told it would save ""at risk"" pregnancies, but was proven to cause miscarriages and also induce breast cancer for mothers. Cancer, infertility, and epididymal cysts were just some of the effects on the children who were exposed in utero. Still, it took the FDA more than 30 years to instruct doctors not to use it on pregnant women.

University","History, Humanities, Diversity/Equity/Inclusion, Women's Studies, Global Studies",Five College Women's Studies Research Center,"Tue, Mar 7, 2017",4-6pm,"Umass Amherst, Amherst, MA","Karma R. Ch√°vez, University of Texas Austin, will be speaking. 

Upon the election of Trump as President of the US, undocumented 
immigrant students and their allies scrambled to strategize mechanisms 
of support for those who feared losing their protected status under 
Obama's 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) executive 
order. Given that Trump has explicitly said he will repeal DACA and take 
an aggressive and enforcement-only approach to immigration more broadly, 
the already precarious situation for all immigrants living in the US 
seemed all the more dire. University committees, student groups, and 
academic organizations began strategizing about what it would mean to 
make universities ""sanctuaries"" for undocumented students. Several 
hundred university presidents signed on to a letter in Dec. 2016 
declaring their support for undocumented students, though the terms of 
that support was unspecified. This paper considers the various 
dimensions of the question of the university as a sanctuary space as 
posed in popular discourse, what it might mean for the university to 
actually be safe, or at least safer for its most marginalized residents, 
and how these questions might open new space to think about ways revise, 
recreate and promote the mission of the public university amid 
conservative backlash, austerity, and privatization.",https://calendar.google.com/calendar/render?eid=NDd2M2dnMWNlMzZhcDExajFpOWNrNnNyZzQgZmN3c3JjQG0&ctz=America/New_York&sf=true&output=xml#eventpage_6,

It seeks to build bridges between cultural heritage, ecology, economics and ethics.

There will be a dinner and welcome reception, followed by a film, Thursday evening at 6:30 pm at UMass Amherst. The symposium will take place Friday, 9 a.m.‚Äì5 p.m. in Cole Assembly Hall at Amherst College. We will have a TEK plant walk on Saturday at 10 a.m.

We hope to bring Indigenous innovators from our region, the northeast, together with scientists and scholars working on TEK, sustainability and climate change at the regional and international level for the purpose of exchange, deliberation, and mutual education.

Indigenous languages emphasize the animacy of the land, and all the living beings who rely upon the land‚Äôs sustenance for survival.

As Robin Kimmerer notes, we have much to gain from intertwining and comparing the long, ongoing intellectual tradition of Indigenous knowledge, embedded in language and written on the land, with scientific knowledge.

As ‚Äúa cumulative body of knowledge, practice, and belief‚Äù (Berkes 1999) developed by Indigenous communities over thousands of years, TEK provides a core source for understanding ecological patterns and processes as well as ecosystem structure and function, and for developing innovative approaches to conservation, remediation and restoration in local places and global networks.",https://www.fivecolleges.edu/calendar-of-events/listings/node/161363,

Students from each of the Five Colleges organize the festival with the assistance of a Student Director from the host college and a faculty advisor.

Selected works are shown at the festival and awards are given.

From among the pool of films and videos selected to screen at the festival, 10 will be awarded prizes. This year, these 10 prizes for outstanding work will be given titles based on jury evaluation (i.e. ""most outstanding ____""), written reasons for their selection, and one will be named best of festival!

From Abortion Rights to Social Justice: Building the Movement for Reproductive Freedom,"Humanities, History, Global Studies, Diversity/Equity/Inclusion, Women's Studies",Civil Liberties and Public Policy (CLPP) and Hampshire College,"April 7-9, 2017",All day,"Hampshire College, Amherst, MA","From Abortion Rights to Social Justice: Building the Movement for Reproductive Freedom is the conference where CLPP invites people who are completely new to reproductive and social justice to learn alongside those who have shaped, shaken up, and laid new ground for our movements for years. We are students, activists, researchers, scholars, advocates, and justice-seekers. We come together. We vision. We share our successes and challenges. We hold each other accountable. We share our experiences. 
 
With lifelong activists, newly inspired justice-seekers, veteran CLPP conference goers, and first-timers, the conference home that we are creating is approaching its 40th year. We celebrate our strength because we survive and share our resources so that we continue to thrive.  We come together to share power and build new skills. We come together to build the movement for reproductive freedom. We come home.
 
Our communities are strong and resilient. The reproductive justice movement was birthed by women of color who said, We can‚Äôt experience our power without abortion, without support for our families, without celebrating our choices to parent or not to parent, and without justice. At the annual CLPP conference, we join together to celebrate this strong legacy of justice-making and to build our movements.
 
At the conference, we strive to create a space where those at the frontlines of our struggles for justice are centered and our lived experiences are valued. Our vision is to create a home for the visible leadership of those most impacted by reproductive injustices: women of color, trans women, LGBTQ people, those who have been incarcerated, poor and working class people, youth, students, people with disabilities, immigrants, indigenous people, and others who are most acutely affected by reproductive, environmental, and social injustices. 
 
We come together to listen and learn, to hold space to respond to the traumas inflicted upon our communities. We know that coming home is not always comfortable. We interrogate our discomfort. We expand our conversations about race and racism‚Äîabout white supremacy‚Äîaffirming that Black Lives Matter is central to achieving reproductive justice. 
 
We know that coming home is hard work. At the CLPP conference, we center our desires for justice, and we hold back the tide. We vision for ourselves, our communities, our environments, and our society. 
 
We celebrate the ways that we are creating the world that we want to live in. We tell our stories of abortions that we wanted, that we didn‚Äôt want, that we had to fight for, and that we could not live without. We celebrate our creations‚Äîour art, our stories, our families, our communities. We tell stories of the children and families we have had to fight to create. We celebrate through story, and we envision a world where each of us experiences power, pleasure, and autonomy.
 
Come home to the CLPP conference to be inspired. Come to the conference to recalibrate for action. Come to celebrate the beauty and resilience of our movements. Reconnect with old friends, meet new strategic partners and mentors. Come create space with your communities and with new communities‚Äîto build a vision centering diverse histories, identities, experiences and narratives. We don‚Äôt all come to the CLPP conference as leaders, but we all take back new stories and skills to empower our communities.  
 
We hope you will share both your experiences and your desire to learn with us on April 7-9, 2017. Join us to find out how your work, your communities, and the issues you care about are part of the movement we are building for reproductive freedom.",https://clpp.hampshire.edu/conference/2017-conference,
