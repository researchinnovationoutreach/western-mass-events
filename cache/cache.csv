However, the physics of granular media present significant complexities that are still poorly understood. Impact of granular targets by solid projectiles is an experimental approach to understanding force transmission in soft matter. A granular target can cause a free-falling projectile to come to an abrupt stop as its momentum is dissipated to the grains. A complete interpretation of the stopping force, incorporating grain-scale interactions during impact, remains unresolved. We use direct force measurements and high-speed imaging to determine the forces acting on a projectile as it decelerates through a dense granular medium. These impact studies probe the unique response and properties of granular media.",https://www.amherst.edu/academiclife/departments/physics/seminars_and_colloquia/node/652287,

He has worked as an endangered species biologist throughout the U.S., and for the past 25 years has focused on threatened and endangered bat species.

Bat populations in the Northeast have been decimated over the past decade by a fungal pathogen known as White Nose Syndrome (WNS). Mr. Fishman developed a bat research program on Long Island, New York, to determine how WNS had impacted bat populations there. The resulting Long Island Century Bat Survey (LICBS), the most intensive bat survey conducted on Long Island in more than 100 years, revealed some surprising results. Bat species that were all but extirpated on the mainland continued to thrive on Long Island.

Michael will discuss this work, as well as continuing bat research that was spawned from the LICBS, which has found that this effect is exhibited along the Northeastern coastal plain. He will discuss hypotheses currently being explored to determine why bats infected with WNS are surviving in the coastal plain, and the implications this may have for long-term bat species conservation.",http://www.westfield.ma.edu/guest-lecture-series,

Professor Ching writes that ""to make an Apollonian Circle Packing you start with three mutually tangent circles in a plane and add those new circles that are tangent to all three. Then you add new circles tangent to three you already have and repeat forever. The resulting collection of circles forms a beautiful fractal-like picture. But what sorts of pictures are possible? How much of the plane gets covered by the resulting circles? And how do the answers depend on which three circles you started with? Sunny discovered new circle packings with extra symmetry that increased our understanding of these issues, but there is still a lot to be worked out.""",https://www.amherst.edu/news/calendar/node/675784,

Buddhism in Current China - lecture by The Venerable Yifa,"Religion, History, Humanities","Hampshire College, Smith College, Amherst College","Wed, Mar 1, 2017",,5:00pm-7:00pm,"Hampshire College, Amherst, MA","As the founder of the Woodenfish Project in 2002 which moved from Taiwan to mainland China in 2009, the Ven. Yifa has been a first-hand witness of many changes and revivals within the Buddhist community in China. In her lecture, the Ven. Yifa will share her reflections on the phenomena of Buddhist rejuvenation in current China. During the first phase in the 1980's after China's Cultural Revolution, Buddhist leaders derived policies to revive Buddhism. During the second phase, after the thirty years of Deng Xiaoping's economic reforms, reconstruction of giant temples and monasteries on historical sites mushroomed around the country. Under the surface of massive temple reconstruction, we find struggles sparking between the monastic communities that want to uphold cultural traditions, local governments seeking revenue from entrance fees, and investing developers craving monetary profits from temple tourism. The rule and management of sacred temples are in the hands of investors who plan to put the temples to IPO (initial public offering), but some are stopped by the central government's decrees. As we now enter the third phase, the Chinese Buddhist community faces a challenge of cultivating a new generation of more talented monastics to fill the new, massive temples by promoting seminary education and facilitating more modern internet media and propagation of Buddhist dharma. 

The ven. Dr. Yifa is abbess of Woodenfish Foundation (Beijing), a lawyer and a scholar of philosophy and religious studies. She is a leader in interreligious dialogue, Buddhist education and in advocacy for women's health and women's rights. Her work has been central to the development of Buddhist political, educational and charitable work in East Asia.

Data Science Seminar: Causal data mining: Estimating causal effects at scale,"Science, STEM, Math",Umass Amherst College of Information and Computer Science,"Wed, Mar 1, 2017",,4:00pm-5:00pm,"Umass Amherst, Amherst, MA","Abstract: Identifying causal effects is an integral part of scientific inquiry, spanning a wide range of questions such as understanding behavior in online systems, effect of social policies, or risk factors for diseases. In the absence of a randomized experiment, however, traditional methods such as matching or instrumental variables fail to provide robust estimates because they depend on strong assumptions that are never tested.
In this talk, I first show that many of the strong assumptions are testable and propose a data mining framework  for causal inference from observed data: instead of relying on untestable assumptions, we develop tests for valid experiment-like data---a ""natural"" experiment---and estimate causal effects only from subsets of data that pass those tests. I will present two such methods. The first utilizes auxiliary data from large-scale systems to automate the search for natural experiments. Applying it to estimate the additional activity caused by Amazon's recommendation system, I find over 20,000 natural experiments, an order of magnitude more than those in past work. These experiments indicate that less than half of the click-throughs typically attributed to the recommendation system are causal; the rest would have happened anyways. The second method proposes a general Bayesian test that can be used for validating natural experiments in any dataset. For instance, I find that a majority of natural experiments used in recent studies in a premier economics journal are likely invalid. More generally, the proposed framework presents a viable way of doing causal inference in large-scale datasets with minimal assumptions.

Bio: Amit Sharma is a postdoctoral researcher at Microsoft Research, New York. His research focuses on understanding the underlying mechanisms that shape people's activities online, with a particular emphasis on the effect of recommendation systems and social influence. More generally, his work contributes to methods for causal inference from large-scale data, combining principles from Bayesian graphical models, data mining and machine learning. He completed his Ph.D. in computer science at Cornell University. He is a recipient of the 2012 Yahoo! Key Scientific Challenges Award and the 2009 Honda Young Engineer and Scientist Award.

Social Science Matters: 'Border Walls and the Politics of Becoming Non-Human',"History, Humanities, Global Studies, Diversity/Equity/Inclusion",Umass Amherst,"Thu, Mar 2, 2017",,4:00 PM,"Umass Amherst, Amherst, MA","Miriam Ticktin, Associate Professor of Anthropology & Co-Director of Zolberg Institute for Migration and Mobility, The New School, will present on her book Casualties of Care: Immigration and the Politics of Humanitarianism in France, which takes undocumented immigrants as the subject of extensive ethnographic research and looks at the place of gender, humanitarianism and the body in debates over immigration -- primarily in France.

In this lecture, Ticktin is concerned by the ways in which border walls and zones come not simply to defend (i.e. certain territories), but to define  -- that is, to shape or alter categories of natural and human kinds. She will suggest that borders walls, and all the surrounding and auxiliary technologies they harness, work by shifting how we understand different kinds of beings, ultimately rendering certain kinds killable. She will look at practices of quarantine, containment, and the design of walls themselves.",http://www.umass.edu/events/social-science-matters-border,

Co-Sponsored by the Department of Politics   

The anthropocene is often defined as the era of human mastery over the earth, where humans have come to shape climate, geology, and time itself to terrifying and destructive effect. Yet one of the causes of the anthropocene's climate violence is the very idea of human mastery, or more precisely the belief that freedom equals human mastery over nature. The ideal of freedom as it has been understood in much Anglo-American politics -- freedom defined as sovereign individualism, as unbound agency, and as private ownership of nature -- is partly accountable for the geological violence that marks the anthropocene. Different visions of freedom might be crucial for reshaping political imaginaries toward slowing ecological destruction. By placing scientific research on gut microbiota and DNA in dialogue with political theories of agency, I offer different political imaginaries that repudiate individualism to envision free action not limited to the self-determining human that can master nature.",https://events.mtholyoke.edu/MasterCalendar/EventDetails.aspx?EventDetailId=42904,

For instance, if you simply look at a polynomial as a sum of terms, and plot a point for each term in a certain way, you naturally get a polygon from which you can read off important information about the complex roots. We explain these tricks, and how they relate to 19th century work on the Riemann zeta function and new results about solving systems of polynomial equation. There are also relations to the exciting new field called tropical geometry. We start from scratch, and assume no background beyond second semester calculus and a modest acquaintance with complex numbers.""",https://www.amherst.edu/news/calendar/node/673305,

"The Garbage Problem: Corruption, Capacity, and Access in Four American Cities, 1880-1910","History, Humanities, Sustainability, Social Justice",Umass Amherst Department of Political Science,"Thu, Mar 2, 2017",,3:00 PM,"Umass Amherst, Amherst, MA","As populations grew rapidly in American cities during the late-nineteenth century, so did waste. Trash filled yards, vacant lots, and city streets. At the same time, municipal governments‚Äîbest poised to address this problem‚Äîwere often corrupt, though in different ways. So, how did different forms of corruption affect what governments chose to do? And, what was the impact of their actions on democratic governance?  The garbage problem inconvenienced and vexed nineteenth-century Americans, but this municipal challenge provides an unparalleled opportunity for contemporary scholars to understand how different forms of corruption affect capacity and access. In this paper we look at four cities‚ÄîPittsburgh, Charleston, New Orleans, and St. Louis‚Äîthat were in principle democratic, but in practice were ruled by informal (corrupt) governing systems, which had greater or lesser ability to accomplish policy objectives (capacity), and which shaped social order and access (access). We show that decisionmaking around garbage collection and disposal was influenced by informal governing systems, creating more or less functional trash capacity and shaping whose voice was heard.

What is the importance of these objects in defining the meaning of citizenship? Should the problem of gun violence be thought about as an epidemiological issue or as a matter of criminal justice? Explorations of these questions might take myriad forms. It will look at the literary and symbolic life of guns and those who study guns as objects of cultural practice and ritual across the world.  It will also seek to investigate the importance of guns in changing social and political conditions, including-for example-in colonial expansion by European powers, in the militarization of ‚Äúthe police,‚Äù or in racially charged violence in U.S. cities. 

The conference will feature presentations from a number of distinguished experts including Elisabeth Anker (George Washington University), Harel Shapira (University of Texas), Timothy Luke (Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University), Joanna Bourke (University of London), Franklin Zimring (University of California, Berkeley) and David Yamane (Wake Forest University). The conference is sponsored by the 2016-17 Copeland Colloquium, as part of a series of events organized to explore the symbolic and culture construction of guns and to ask questions about the symbolic value of guns and the meanings the weapons used in the making of day-to-day violence convey.

Trade-offs in Campaign Finance Reform: Less Money or More Donors,"History, Humanities",Umass Amherst School of Public Policy,"Mon, Mar 6, 2017",,12:15-1:15pm,"Umass Amherst, Amherst, MA","The School of Public Policy (SPP) will kick off its Spring 2017 Faculty Colloquium series with a talk by Meredith Rolfe, associate professor of political science.

Rolfe‚Äôs talk, ‚ÄúTrade-offs in Campaign Finance Reform: Less Money or More Donors,‚Äù will draw on her recent paper about that topic. In an era where the role of big money in politics has come under increased scrutiny and voters are concerned about potential corruption in the political system, there is increasing interest in the public financing of political campaigns. Reformers have argued that adoption of public financing systems, particularly voucher systems such as Seattle‚Äôs innovative Democracy Vouchers program, can increase citizen participation in election financing, reduce the inequality among donors, reduce corruption, and attract a wider range of competitive candidates.
In the paper, Rolfe and her collaborators formally model the structural constraints present in all campaign finance systems, such as the fixed relationship between total campaign spending, average contribution size and total number of donors. They find that prior analysis may significantly overstate the ability of public funding programs such as those in Seattle to generate significant increases in the number of people who donate to political campaigns. Instead, structural limits on campaign spending and candidate participation may result in an overall decrease in the proportion of citizens donating to municipal elections. Their analysis highlights the inherent trade-offs in any campaign finance policy between the goals of increasing donor participation, limiting campaign spending, and reducing inequality among donors.

Michelson a Political Science Professor at Menlo College and Brian F. Harrison a Lecturer in Political Science at Northwestern University will come to talk about their new book: ""Listen, We Need to Talk - How to Change Attitudes about LGBT Rights"".

‚ÄúIn this excellent, timely, and persuasive book, Harrison and Michelson offer a theory of how even committed opponents can be incentivized to listen to persuasive messages regarding disadvantaged groups. Priming common social identities, they find, can reduce mutual alienation. This is groundbreaking theoretical and empirical work!‚Äù

American public opinion tends to be sticky. Although the news cycle might temporarily affect the public's mood on contentious issues like abortion, the death penalty, or gun control, public opinion toward these issues has remained remarkably constant over decades. There are notable exceptions, however, particularly with regard to divisive issues that highlight identity politics. For example, over the past three decades, public support for same-sex marriage has risen from scarcely more than a tenth to a majority of the population. Why have people's minds changed so dramatically on this issue, and why so quickly? It wasn't just that older, more conservative people were dying and being replaced in the population by younger, more progressive people; people were changing their minds. Was this due to the influence of elite leaders like President Obama? Or advocacy campaigns by organizations pushing for greater recognition of the equal rights of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) people? 
 
Listen, We Need to Talk tests a new theory, what Brian Harrison and Melissa Michelson call The Theory of Dissonant Identity Priming, about how to change people's attitudes on controversial topics. Harrison and Michelson conducted randomized experiments all over the United States, many in partnership with equality organizations, including Equality Illinois, Georgia Equality, Lambda Legal, Equality Maryland, and Louisiana's Capital City Alliance. They found that people are often willing to change their attitudes about LGBT rights when they find out that others with whom they share an identity (for example, as sports fans or members of a religious group) are also supporters of those rights-particularly when told about support from a leader of the group, and particularly if they find the information somewhat surprising. Through a series of engaging experiments and compelling evidence, Listen, We Need to Talk provides a blueprint for thinking about how to bring disparate groups together over contentious political issues.

Many internal physiological processes in our body produce subtle vibrations with different frequencies, which carry representative information about the state of our health. Similarly, characteristics of externally induced vibrations in our surrounding environment can be indicative of whether any materials or chemicals can pose threats to our health. In my research, I exploit acoustic waves, electromagnetic waves, and their interactions to develop mobile systems that passively and unobtrusively listen to underlying health signals. Despite the rapid growth of mobile health applications in recent years, many of these health sensing modalities remain largely untapped.
In this talk, I will present my recent and ongoing research to demonstrate how naturally generated and backscattered acoustic and electromagnetic waves from the human body (e.g., heart, skin) and its surrounding material environment (e.g., food, air) can be used to infer intermediate health signals like non-speech body sounds, vital signs, and spectral properties of materials. I will also describe how these signals can be mapped to high-level health and behavioral variables including eating event, sleep stages, and food quality. Finally, I will lay out my future plans to develop low-cost next-generation mobile health systems that will enable individualized and community-wide healthcare, which include transdermal sensing of harmful chemicals and microorganisms, incidence and spread prediction of deadly infectious diseases, and characterization of harmful materials in our immediate environment.
Bio: Tauhidur Rahman is a Ph.D. candidate in Information Science in the People-Aware Computing lab at Cornell University, advised by Dr. Tanzeem Choudhury. His current research focuses on building novel ubiquitous and mobile health sensing technologies that capture observable low-level physical signals in the form of an acoustic and electromagnetic wave from our bodies and surrounding environments and map them to relevant biological and behavioral measurements. Some of his notable accomplishments include a Google Ph.D. fellowship in 2016 in mobile computing, a finalist position in Qualcomm innovation fellowship in 2015, Outstanding Teaching Award 2015 from Cornell University, one best paper award in ACM Digital Health 2016, one best paper honorable mention award in ACM Ubicomp 2015. He published in top-tier CS conferences including ACM MobiSys, SenSys and Ubicomp.

Social Science Matters: 'Sanctuary and Undocumented Students',"History, Humanities, Diversity/Equity/Inclusion, Gender Studies, Global Studies, Social Justice",Five College Women's Studies Research Center and UMass Amherst,"Tue, Mar 7, 2017",,4:00-6:00pm,"Umass Amherst, Amherst, MA","Karma Ch√°vez, associate professor and director of graduate studies, department of Mexican American & Latina/o Studies, University of Texas-Austin, will present on her research.

Upon the election of Trump as President of the US, undocumented immigrant students and their allies scrambled to strategize mechanisms of support for those who feared losing their protected status under Obama's 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) executive order. Given that Trump has explicitly said he will repeal DACA and take an aggressive and enforcement-only approach to immigration more broadly, the already precarious situation for all immigrants living in the US seemed all the more dire. University committees, student groups, and academic organizations began strategizing about what it would mean to make universities ""sanctuaries"" for undocumented students. Several hundred university presidents signed on to a letter in Dec. 2016 declaring their support for undocumented students, though the terms of that support was unspecified. This paper considers the various dimensions of the question of the university as a sanctuary space as posed in popular discourse, what it might mean for the university to actually be safe, or at least safer for its most marginalized residents, and how these questions might open new space to think about ways revise, recreate and promote the mission of the public university amid conservative backlash, austerity, and privatization.

Ch√°vez's scholarship is primarily informed by queer of color theory and women of color feminism. Methodologically, she is a rhetorical critic who variously utilizes textual and field based methods. She is interested in studying social movement building, activist rhetoric, and coalitional politics. Her work emphasizes the rhetorical practices of groups marginalized within existing power structures, but she also attends to rhetoric produced by powerful institutions and actors about marginalized folks and the systems that oppress them (e.g., immigration system, prisons etc.).

A solitonic approach to neutron stars: The (BPS) Skyrme model,"Math, Science",Umass Amherst Department of Mathematics & Statistics,"Fri, Mar 17, 2017",,12:00 PM,"Umass Amherst, Amherst, MA","Event Category: Applied Analysis and Computation Seminar 
Speaker: Carlos Naya-Rodriguez 
Institution: Durham University

The Skyrme model is a low energy effective field theory of strong interactions where nuclei and baryons appear as collective excitations of pionic degrees of freedom. Proposed by Tony Skyrme in the sixties, his ideas received further support when it was discovered that in the limit of the large number of colours of QCD, an effective theory of mesons arises. In the last years, there has been a revival of Skyrme's ideas and new related models, some of them with BPS bounds (topological lower energy bounds), have been proposed. It is the aim of this talk to focus on the one known as BPS Skyrme model. After a brief introduction to this BPS limit we study its application to neutron stars where we will find that high maximal masses are supported. In addition, the BPS Skyrme model allow us to perform both mean-field and exact calculations and a comparison between both approaches will be presented.",https://www.math.umass.edu/calendar/applied-analysis-and-computation-seminar/16938,

‚ÄúTuning Up‚Äù in Contemporary Gospel Performance by Braxton D. Shelley (U. Chicago),"Religion, Humanities, Music",Amherst College,"Mon, Mar 20, 2017",,4:30 PM,"Amhest College, Amhest, MA","The Music Department continues ‚ÄúNew Perspectives in American Music,‚Äù a four-part spring semester 2017 speaker series, with ""'Tuning Up' in Contemporary Gospel Performance"" a talk by Braxton D. Shelley (U. Chicago) at 4:30 p.m. on Monday, March 20, 2017, at the Center for Humanistic Inquiry, Frost Library, Amherst College.

For practitioners of many African American Christian traditions, ‚Äútuning up‚Äù is a colloquial referent for a preacher‚Äôs shift from speech into song, most often at the end of a sermon. This phenomenon and its antecedents lie at the heart of many scholarly examinations of black preaching, ranging from Bruce Rosenburg‚Äôs ""Can These Bones Live?: The Art of the American Folk Preacher"" (1970) to Frank Thomas‚Äô ""They Like to Never Quit Praisin‚Äô God: The Role of Celebration in Preaching."" (1977) These observations concerning the musicality of black preaching depend on an analogy between such sermons and gospel songs. Although scholars have noted the interrelation of African American preaching and African American gospel music (Floyd 1997; Ramsey 2003), their relationship has not yet been used as a means to theorize gospel performance.

Braxton extends ‚Äútuning up‚Äù from its specific role in black preaching to contemporary gospel performance, considering this practice as an analytic for formal procedure in gospel music. He begins by analyzing excerpts from sermons‚ÄîBishop James Morton‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Lazarus Conspiracy"", Rev. Dr. Gina Stewart‚Äôs ‚ÄúAm I My Brother and My Sister‚Äôs Keeper‚Äù and Rev. Dr. E. Dewey Smith‚Äôs ‚ÄúA Seminary From A Cemetery‚Äù‚Äîto illustrate the different forms this practice can take. He then uses homiletics, ritual theory, practice theory and phenomenology to argue that ‚Äútuning up‚Äù is a means of organizing attention. Close readings of three gospel songs‚ÄîRichard Smallwood‚Äôs ‚ÄúHealing,‚Äù (1998) Myrna Summer‚Äôs ‚ÄúOh How Precious,‚Äù (1975) and Brenda Moore‚Äôs ‚ÄúPerfect Praise‚Äù (1989)‚Äîto illustrate how the vamp, the repetitive ending cycle that is one of gospel‚Äôs central features, musically performs the process of ‚Äútuning up.‚Äù As in the sermons, and in similar settings, the structure and performance of each of these songs invites an attention shift concomitant with the beginning of its vamp. It constitutes a shift in performance that calls forth a change in perception‚Äîfrom the individual to the collective, and from the ear to the body, engendering a communal perception that lies at the heart of the gospel aesthetic.

Braxton D. Shelley is a PhD candidate in the history and theory of music at the University of Chicago; he is also finishing a Master of Divinity in the University of Chicago‚Äôs Divinity School. He earned a BA in music and history from Duke University. His dissertation, ""Sermons in Song: Richard Smallwood, the Vamp, and the Gospel Imagination"", develops an analytical paradigm for gospel music that braids together resources from cognitive theory, ritual theory and homiletics with studies of repetition, form, rhythm and meter. He has presented his research at Northwestern University‚Äôs Music Theory and Cognition Workshop, Harvard University‚Äôs Graduate Music Forum, Music Theory Midwest, and the Society for Christian Scholarship in Music.",https://www.amherst.edu/academiclife/departments/music/events/node/670833,

Far From Sanctuary: African American Travel and the Road to Civil Rights,"History, Humanities, Diversity/Equity/Inclusion",Umass Amherst,"Tue, Mar 21, 2017",,4:00 PM,"Umass Amherst, Amherst, MA","2017 Writer-in-Residence: Allyson Hobbs presents ""Far From Sanctuary: African American Travel and the Road to Civil Rights.""

This talk argues that the national fraternity of American motorists excluded African Americans during the early to mid-twentieth century despite the ostensibly democratic nature of the ‚Äúopen road.‚Äù Providing a textured account of the emotional lives of black drivers including the sense of pride, the seduction, and the exhilaration that owning a car offered, this talk also considers the fears and anxieties that arose once African Americans motorists got behind the wheel. The road was (and certainly, still is) a site of racial contestation. This talk calls for a reconsideration of ‚Äúautomobility‚Äù and the role of the car in African American culture. 

Allyson Hobbs is an associate professor in the department of distory and Director of African and African American Studies at Stanford University.  She is a contributing staff writer for the New Yorker.com and a Distinguished Lecturer for the Organization of American Historians. Allyson‚Äôs first book, A Chosen Exile: A History of Racial Passing in American Life, published by Harvard University Press in 2014, examines the phenomenon of racial passing in the United States from the late eighteenth century to the present.

"Data Science Seminar: Rethinking algorithms in Data Science: Scaling up optimization using non-convexity, provably","Science, STEM, Math",Umass Amherst College of Information and Computer Science,"Tue, Mar 21, 2017",,4:00pm-5:00pm,"Umass Amherst, Amherst, MA","Abstract:  With the quantity of generated data ever-increasing in most research areas, conventional data analytics run into solid computational, storage, and communication bottlenecks. These obstacles force practitioners to often use algorithmic heuristics, in an attempt to convert data into useful information, fast. It is necessary to rethink the algorithmic design, and devise smarter and provable methods in order to flexibly balance the trade-offs between solution accuracy, efficiency, and data interpretability.
In this talk, Anastasios will focus on the problem of low rank matrix inference in large-scale settings. Such problems appear in fundamental applications such as structured inference, recommendation systems and multi-label classification problems. He will introduce a novel theoretical framework for analyzing the performance of non-convex first-order methods, often used as heuristics in practice. These methods lead to computational gains over classic convex approaches, but their analysis is unknown for most problems. This talk will provide precise theoretical guarantees, answering the long-standing question ""why such non-convex techniques behave well in practice?"" for a wide class of problems. He will discuss implementation details of these ideas and show the superior performance we can obtain in applications found in physical sciences and machine learning.

Bio:  Anastasios Kyrillidis received his PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL) in 2014. Currently, he is a Simons Fellowship PostDoc researcher at the University of Texas (Austin). His research interests include convex/non-convex optimization and analysis, large-scale machine learning, and high-dimensional data analysis.",https://www.cics.umass.edu/event/data-science-seminar-rethinking-algorithms-data-science-scaling-optimization-using-non,

Concert: Magic Triangle Jazz Series presents: Mary Halvorson's Reverse Blue,"Arts, Music",Umass Amherst,"Mon, Mar 27, 2017",,8:00 PM,"Umass Amherst, Amherst, MA","Free admission.

The Magic Triangle Jazz Series, produced by the Fine Arts Center at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, in collaboration with the Smith College Department of Music, continues its 28th season with a performance by Mary Halvorson‚Äôs Reverse Blue, featuring Mary Halvorson, guitar, Chris Speed, saxophone, clarinet, Eivind Opsvik, bass and Tomas Fujiwara, drums. The concert is free and open to the public.

One of improvised music‚Äôs most in-demand guitarists, Mary Halvorson has been active in New York since 2002, following jazz studies at Wesleyan University and the New School. Critics have called her ‚Äúa singular talent‚Äù (Lloyd Sachs, JazzTimes), ‚ÄúNYC‚Äôs least-predictable improviser‚Äù (Howard Mandel, City Arts), ‚Äúone of the most exciting and original guitarists in jazz‚Äîor otherwise‚Äù (Steve Dollar, Wall Street Journal), and ‚Äúone of today‚Äôs most formidable bandleaders‚Äù (Francis Davis, Village Voice). 

After three years of study with visionary composer and saxophonist Anthony Braxton, Halvorson became an active member of several of his bands, including his trio, septet and 12+1tet. To date, she has appeared on six of Braxton‚Äôs recordings. Halvorson has also performed alongside iconic guitarist Marc Ribot, in his bands Sun Ship and The Young Philadelphians, and with the bassist Trevor Dunn in his Trio-Convulsant. Over the past decade she has worked with such diverse bandleaders as Tim Berne, Taylor Ho Bynum, Ingrid Laubrock, Myra Melford, Jason Moran, Joe Morris, Tom Rainey and Mike Reed.

As a bandleader and composer, one of Ms. Halvorson‚Äôs primary outlet is her longstanding trio, featuring bassist John H√©bert and drummer Ches Smith. Since their 2008 debut album, Dragon‚Äôs Head, the band has been recognized as a rising star jazz band by Downbeat Magazine for five consecutive years. Ms. Halvorson‚Äôs quintet, which adds trumpeter Jonathan Finlayson and alto saxophonist Jon Irabagon to the trio, has released two critically acclaimed albums on the Firehouse 12 label: Saturn Sings and Bending Bridges. Most recently she has added two additional band members‚Äîtenor saxophonist Ingrid Laubrock and trombonist Jacob Garchik‚Äîto form a septet, featured on her 2013 release, Illusionary Sea. Halvorson also co-leads a longstanding chamber-jazz duo with violist Jessica Pavone, the avant-rock band People and the collective ensembles Thumbscrew and Secret Keeper.

‚ÄúIn the past few years, Mary Halvorson, already an acclaimed member of New York's Downtown improv scene, has been earning widespread recognition as a bandleader and composer of note,‚Äù writes Troy Collins. ‚ÄúHer writing displays an increasing sophistication with each new effort, revealing a compositional maturity as distinctive as her idiosyncratic guitar technique. Her latest ensemble, Reverse Blue, first performed at NYC's Blue Note as part of Search and Restore's ‚ÄòSpontaneous Constructions‚Äô series. Despite their mixed pedigree, there is an aesthetic similarity amongst the tunes that lends a sense of stylistic cohesion to the proceedings. Cohesive, yet varied enough to signify its collaborative nature, Reverse Blue is another exceptional release from one of today's most adventurous artists.‚Äù",http://www.umass.edu/events/concert-magic-triangle-jazz-0,

Data Science Seminar: New Algorithms for High-Dimensional Data,"Math, Science, STEM",Umass Amherst College of Information and Computer Science,"Mon, Mar 27, 2017",,4:00pm-5:00pm,"Umass Amherst, Amherst, MA","ABSTRACT: A popular approach in data analysis is to represent a dataset in a high-dimensional feature space, and reduce a given task to a geometric computational problem. However, most of the classic geometric algorithms scale poorly as the dimension grows and are typically not applicable to the high-dimensional regime. This necessitates the development of new algorithmic approaches that overcome this ""curse of dimensionality"". In this talk I will give an overview of my work in this area.
I will describe new algorithms for the high-dimensional Nearest Neighbor Search (NNS) problem, where the goal is to preprocess a dataset so that, given a query object, one can quickly retrieve one or several closest objects from the dataset. Our algorithms improve, for the first time, upon the popular Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) approach.
Next, I will show how to make several algorithmic ideas underlying the above theoretical results practical. This yields an implementation which is competitive with the state of the art heuristics for the NNS problem. The implementation is a part of FALCONN: a new open-source library for similarity search.

Finally, I will talk about limits of distance-preserving sketching, i.e., compression methods that approximately preserve the distances between high-dimensional vectors. In particular, we will show that for the well-studied Earth Mover Distance (EMD) such efficient compression is impossible.
The common theme that unifies these and other algorithms for high-dimensional data is the use of ""efficient data representations"": randomized hashing, sketching, dimensionality reduction, metric embeddings, and others. One goal of the talk is to describe a holistic view of all of these techniques.

BIO: Ilya Razenshteyn is a graduate student at the Theory of Computation group of MIT CSAIL advised by Piotr Indyk. He is broadly interested in the theory of algorithms for massive data with a bias towards algorithms which have the potential of being useful for applications. More specific interests include: similarity search, sketching, metric embeddings, high-dimensional geometry, streaming algorithms, and compressed sensing. Ilya graduated with M.Sc. in Mathematics from Moscow State University back in 2012. His awards include Akamai Presidential Fellowship and Simons Foundation Junior Fellowship.

Prof. at the University of Colorado, Boulder

White supremacists, ethnic separatists and cultural ultraconservatives populate Sweden‚Äôs scene of self-identified nationalists. Despite pronounced ideological and social differences among nationalists, most can trace their activism to a cultural movement that engulfed Western Europe during the 1990s: skinheadism.

Skinhead style and white power music provided vital fundraising and recruiting channels for radical nationalists in Sweden. But with its hooliganism, male chauvinism and hate rhetoric, this subculture also repulsed much of the Swedish mainstream, and prevented opponents of immigration from making appreciable political gains. Teitelbaum's talk explores activists' efforts to reject skinheadism and refashion themselves as upstanding agents of love and justice. He connects this reformist campaign with nationalists‚Äô emerging interest in showcasing traditional femininities in their expressive culture. His analysis centers on the works and reception of Swedish singer Saga‚Äîcurrently the most popular musician in the greater white nationalist world. He shows how Saga and similar artists create gendered portrayals of white victimization in their music, portrayals that reinforce (male) nationalists‚Äô images of themselves as defenders of the oppressed. Teitelbaum's discussion offers insight into the shifting conceptual terrain of radical nationalism at a time when this movement is achieving unprecedented political gains throughout the Nordic region and Europe beyond.",https://www.amherst.edu/academiclife/departments/music/events/node/675816,

-- Jude Rittenhouse

How can all people engage in solidarity to change sexism?

During this dialogue we will increase our understanding of people in the room and increase our understanding and love for ourselves. In the early 1960‚Äòs sexism was called ‚Äúthe problem that has no name.‚Äù Today we know each person is welcome and needed in the struggle to change the systemic oppressions that skew our human community.

This two-hour dialogue will include a time to choose a personal story from today or childhood to share in small groups relating to gender messages or how sexism has intervened. Together we will build connection because we will give each other and ourselves the food of understanding.

Dialogue leader: Sarah Pirtle, Interfaith Minister and author of five books including An Outbreak of Peace and Better Together. Sarah directs the Common Threads Project of Traprock.

Before the dialogue, please skim for at least 20 minutes Sarah‚Äôs booklet online -- Keeper of the Fire: Dialogue to Change Sexism and Foster Gender Reconciliation. This is found at traprock.org",,
"Mindy Fried, Caring for Red: A Daughter‚Äôs Memoir","English, Humanities",Odyssey Bookshop,"Thu, Mar 30, 2017",,7:00 PM,"Odyssey Bookshop, South Hadley, MA","Caring for Red: A Daughter‚Äôs Memoir is Mindy Fried‚Äôs moving and colorful account about caring for her ninety-seven-year-old father, Manny‚Äîactor, writer, labor organizer, and survivor of political persecution during the McCarthy Era‚Äîin the final year of his life. This memoir chronicles the actions of two sisters as they discover concentric circles of support for their father and attempt to provide him with an experience of ‚Äúengaged aging‚Äù in an assisted living facility.
 
The story is also that of a daughter of a powerful and outspoken man who took risks throughout his life and whose political beliefs had an enduring impact on his family. After Manny was called before the House Un-American Activities Committee, he was blacklisted and his family was shunned.
 
As an actor, Manny was affiliated with Elia Kazan‚Äôs Group Theatre and the Federal Theatre Project. He did Shakespeare, Chekhov, and Ibsen, and played everything from the tormented father in Arthur Miller‚Äôs All My Sons to an infant in a baby carriage in Thornton Wilder‚Äôs Infancy, from the Rabbi in Fiddler on the Roof to‚Äîpoignantly for this book‚Äîthe role of Morrie in Tuesdays with Morrie.
 
Caring for Red brings a personal perspective and a sociological eye to care giving, as it grapples with universal issues facing thousands of people today. As ethnography, Caring for Red also provides important insights into the culture of assisted living, framing day-to-day life for her father and other residents within a larger sociopolitical context.

This particular scene embodied a spirit of DIY that has come to be synonymous with punk, and it has continued to be an influence on many regional punk scenes around the world.

On Saturday, April 1, from 5-7 pm Cynthia will share her stories and images, some from the book and additional images of ephemera and photos in a quick paced slide show that will tell the story of growing up in Los Angeles where she discovered both art and underground punk music as her calling, and how she got involved in the ‚Äúscene‚Äù. The story unfolds in 1981, with a relocation to Washington, DC where we get to learn more of her involvement with a very small group of kids who contribute and create a world-wide inspirational music movement like no other.

Nearly 30 years later there is still a demand for Banned in D. C., and Cynthia has produced a seventh edition with an 8 page afterword added, which will be available for $25 cash at the event. The event is free but donations for Flywheel will be appreciated.

The Final Flourish: the Rhetoric of the Hat,"History, Humanities",Historic Northampton & Smith College,"Sun, Apr 2, 2017",,2:00 PM,"Historic Northampton, Northampton, MA","Speaker: Margaret Bruzelius, Smith College

Clothes always denote meaning, whether or not the wearer controls or is aware of that meaning. In its heyday, a hat was the punctuation mark, the final inflection of the sentence that was the outfit for both men and women. Beginning with illustrations derived from 30's screwball comedies, Margaret Bruzelius will discuss the patterns of meaning in hats in film: high crown versus low crown, broad versus narrow brim, feathers and trim, and where and how the hat fits on the head.

Now that the hat is largely a stretchy wool or acrylic cap worn in cold weather wear to preserve our ears, the discourse of hats is now opaque to us. But hats, like every other part of the system of clothing, have always sent messages about their wearers: hats have their rhetorics, even if that rhetoric is no longer familiar. Historic Northampton's hats are now separated from their wearers and the clothes they once accessorized, but we can, by thinking about basic hat vocabulary, once again appreciate the messages sent by the feather cocktail hat, the high leather fedora, the cherry bedecked straw hat, the bright straw summer hat.

Margaret Bruzelius is the dean of the senior class and associate dean of Smith College. She became a class dean in 2000. She holds a bachelor's from Harvard, an associate's in fashion design from the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York, and a doctorate from Yale. Bruzelius teaches one class per semester, usually in comparative literature, sometimes in film studies. As a child, Bruzelius lived in Brazil, Argentina, Mexico and Puerto Rico. Before starting college she spent a year living in Copenhagen as a weaver's apprentice. Her hobbies include knitting, thrift shopping, textiles and clothes.",http://www.historicnorthampton.org/rhetoric-of-the-hat.html,

The secrecy and concentrated power under which the first atomic weapons were created provided a model for the post‚ÄìWorld War II permanent national security state, presided over by presidents invested with unprecedented power. Their exclusive authority to produce and use atomic weapons‚Äîcodified by the Atomic Energy Act of 1946‚Äîled to further expansions of presidential powers not conferred by the constitution. The authority to launch globe-threatening weapons has led to a wide range of additional assertions of power unaccountable to the public or its elected representatives, including covert overthrows of foreign governments, secret bombing of foreign nations, unilateral abdication of treaties, warrantless surveillance of American citizens, and routine circumvention of Congress‚Äôs constitutional power to declare war.

This lecture will argue that nuclear weapons are inherently undemocratic and must be abolished before we can begin dismantling the national security state and restoring genuinely representative government.

To understand how these organizations operate, their recruitment strategies, and the factors that have contributed to their proliferation, please join us for a community conversation with Mr. Christian Picciolini, a former white supremacist and the co-founder of Life After Hate. Mr. Picciolini will also share his experience of radicalization, as well as insights about the current socio-political context.

Speaker Bio:
Christian Picciolini was born and raised on the south side of Chicago in a working-class neighborhood called Blue Island, the birthplace of the American white power skinhead movement. At 14 years old, Picciolini became entrenched in the first neo-Nazi skinhead gang in the United States. From violence to weapons, Picciolini immersed himself in the racist skinhead culture at an early age and quickly became one of the movement¬ís most respected leaders and musical influencers.

After leaving the violent far-right hate movement he was part of during his youth, he began the painstaking process of rebuilding his life. Christian earned a degree in International Relations from DePaul University, began his own global entertainment media firm, and was appointed a member of the Chicago Grammy Rock Music Committee and board member for the Chicago Intl. Movies and Music Festival.

In 2016, Christian won an Emmy¬Æ Award for directing and producing ExitUSA's ""There is life after hate"" PSA, and has been nominated for four regional Emmy¬Æ Awards. He is an appointed United Nations-affiliated ambassador for iChangeNations and was honored with a National Statesman award. Christian is an associate for the USC Price 'Homegrown Violent Extremism' program and has worked as an adjunct professor at the college level. He contributed to Google Chairman Eric Schmidt's and Jared Cohen's New York Times bestseller, The New Digital Age.
Most notably, in 2009 he co-founded Life After Hate, a nonprofit helping people disengage from hate and violent extremism.

In 2015, he published his memoirs, Romantic Violence: Memoirs of an American Skinhead.",http://flywheelarts.org/,

He was nine when the vines first wrapped themselves around him and burrowed into his skin. Now a college botany major, Jeremy is desperately looking for a way to listen to the plants and stave off their extinction. But when the grip of the vines becomes too intense and Health Services starts asking questions, he flees to Brooklyn, where fate puts him face to face with a group of climate-justice activists who assure him they have a plan to save the planet, and his plants. As the group readies itself to make a big Earth Day splash, Jeremy soon realizes these eco-terrorists devotion to activism might have him and those closest to him tangled up in more trouble than he was prepared to face. With the help of a determined, differently abled flame from his childhood, Zoe; her deteriorating, once rabble-rousing grandmother; and some shocking and illuminating revelations from the past, Jeremy must weigh completing his mission to save the plants against protecting the ones he loves, and confront the most critical question of all: how do you stay true to the people you care about while trying to change the world?

There will be a dinner and welcome reception, followed by a film, Thursday evening at 6:30 pm at UMass Amherst. The symposium will take place Friday, 9 a.m.‚Äì5 p.m. in Cole Assembly Hall at Amherst College. We will have a TEK plant walk on Saturday at 10 a.m.

We hope to bring Indigenous innovators from our region, the northeast, together with scientists and scholars working on TEK, sustainability and climate change at the regional and international level for the purpose of exchange, deliberation, and mutual education.

Indigenous languages emphasize the animacy of the land, and all the living beings who rely upon the land‚Äôs sustenance for survival.

As Robin Kimmerer notes, we have much to gain from intertwining and comparing the long, ongoing intellectual tradition of Indigenous knowledge, embedded in language and written on the land, with scientific knowledge.

As ‚Äúa cumulative body of knowledge, practice, and belief‚Äù (Berkes 1999) developed by Indigenous communities over thousands of years, TEK provides a core source for understanding ecological patterns and processes as well as ecosystem structure and function, and for developing innovative approaches to conservation, remediation and restoration in local places and global networks.

We are students, activists, researchers, scholars, advocates, and justice-seekers. We come together. We vision. We share our successes and challenges. We hold each other accountable. We share our experiences. 
 
With lifelong activists, newly inspired justice-seekers, veteran CLPP conference goers, and first-timers, the conference home that we are creating is approaching its 40th year. We celebrate our strength because we survive and share our resources so that we continue to thrive.  We come together to share power and build new skills. We come together to build the movement for reproductive freedom. We come home.
 
Our communities are strong and resilient. The reproductive justice movement was birthed by women of color who said, We can‚Äôt experience our power without abortion, without support for our families, without celebrating our choices to parent or not to parent, and without justice. At the annual CLPP conference, we join together to celebrate this strong legacy of justice-making and to build our movements.
 
At the conference, we strive to create a space where those at the frontlines of our struggles for justice are centered and our lived experiences are valued. Our vision is to create a home for the visible leadership of those most impacted by reproductive injustices: women of color, trans women, LGBTQ people, those who have been incarcerated, poor and working class people, youth, students, people with disabilities, immigrants, indigenous people, and others who are most acutely affected by reproductive, environmental, and social injustices. 
 
We come together to listen and learn, to hold space to respond to the traumas inflicted upon our communities. We know that coming home is not always comfortable. We interrogate our discomfort. We expand our conversations about race and racism‚Äîabout white supremacy‚Äîaffirming that Black Lives Matter is central to achieving reproductive justice. 
 
We know that coming home is hard work. At the CLPP conference, we center our desires for justice, and we hold back the tide. We vision for ourselves, our communities, our environments, and our society. 
 
We celebrate the ways that we are creating the world that we want to live in. We tell our stories of abortions that we wanted, that we didn‚Äôt want, that we had to fight for, and that we could not live without. We celebrate our creations‚Äîour art, our stories, our families, our communities. We tell stories of the children and families we have had to fight to create. We celebrate through story, and we envision a world where each of us experiences power, pleasure, and autonomy.
 
Come home to the CLPP conference to be inspired. Come to the conference to recalibrate for action. Come to celebrate the beauty and resilience of our movements. Reconnect with old friends, meet new strategic partners and mentors. Come create space with your communities and with new communities‚Äîto build a vision centering diverse histories, identities, experiences and narratives. We don‚Äôt all come to the CLPP conference as leaders, but we all take back new stories and skills to empower our communities.  
 
We hope you will share both your experiences and your desire to learn with us on April 7-9, 2017. Join us to find out how your work, your communities, and the issues you care about are part of the movement we are building for reproductive freedom.",https://clpp.hampshire.edu/conference/2017-conference,

John Scalzi will be here for his latest book, The Collapsing Empire, and he will be joined in conversation with fellow star authors Scott Lynch and Elizabeth Bear!
 
The first novel of a new space-opera sequence set in an all-new universe by the Hugo Award-winning, New York Times-bestselling author of Redshirts and Old Man's War.‚Äã

One of the most popular and acclaimed science fiction authors to emerge in the last decade, John Scalzi returns with the beginning of all new saga: THE COLLAPSING EMPIRE (A Tor Hardcover; On-sale: March 21, 2017). Entertaining, hilarious, and creative both in his books and his online musings, Scalzi continues to cement his well-deserved prominent place in the literary world.

Our universe is ruled by physics and faster than light travel is not  possible‚Äîuntil the discovery of The Flow, an extra-dimensional field  we can access at certain points in space-time that transport us to other  worlds, around other stars. 
 
Humanity flows away from Earth, into space, and in time forgets our home world and creates a new empire, the Interdependency, whose ethos requires that no one human outpost can survive without the others. It‚Äôs a hedge against interstellar war‚Äîand a system of control for the rulers of the empire.
The Flow is eternal‚Äîbut it is not static. Just as a river changes course, The Flow changes as well, cutting off worlds from the rest of humanity. When it‚Äôs discovered that The Flow is moving, possibly cutting off all human worlds from faster than light travel forever, three individuals‚Äîa scientist, a starship captain and the Empress of the Interdependency‚Äîare in a race against time to discover what, if anything, can be salvaged from an interstellar empire on the brink of collapse.

‚ÄãTHE COLLAPSING EMPIRE is eagerly awaited by all of Scalzi's fans around the world, and also serves as a great new entry point to anyone looking for an intelligent action-packed ‚Äãscience fiction read!

 
JOHN SCALZI is the author of several SF novels including the bestselling  Old Man's War sequence, comprising Old Man's War, The Ghost Brigades,  The Last Colony (a New York Times bestseller), Zoe's Tale, The Human  Division‚Äã, and The End of All Things‚Äã. His other novels include the New York Times bestsellers Lock In, Fuzzy  Nation and Redshirts>; the latter novel won science fiction's Hugo Award in 2013. He also won a Hugo Award for Your Hate Mail Will Be Graded, a collection of essays from his popular blog The Whatever  (whatever.scalzi.com). He lives in Ohio with his wife and daughter.  ‚Äã

Shrill is an uproarious memoir, a feminist rallying cry in a world that thinks gender politics are tedious and that women, especially feminists, can't be funny. In Shrill, Lindy West explores how to survive in a cold, judgmental world and shares how to weather hatred, loneliness, harassment, and loss and still walk away laughing. Ferociously witty and candid, Lindy West is a rare and bewitching talent whose body of work has garnered a coast-to-coast audience of prominent writers, press, booksellers, and men and women alike who are not afraid to hold an honest (and mostly unflattering) mirror up to our own culture.
 
From a painfully shy childhood in which she tried, unsuccessfully, to hide her big body and even bigger opinions; to her public war with stand-up comedians over rape jokes; to her struggle to convince herself, and then the world, that fat people have value; to her accidental activism and never-ending battle royale with Internet trolls, Lindy narrates her life with a blend of humor and pathos that manages to make a trip to the abortion clinic funny and wring tears out of a story about diarrhea.
 
Shrill provocatively dissects what it means to become self-aware the hard way, to go from wanting to be silent and invisible to earning a living defending the silenced in all caps.
 
Lindy West is a Seattle-based writer, editor, and performer whose work focuses on pop culture, social justice, humor, and body image. She‚Äôs currently a culture writer for GQ magazine and a weekly columnist at The Guardian, as well as the founder and editor of I Believe You | It‚Äôs Not your Fault, an advice blog for teens.  In 2015 she wrote and recorded a story for ‚ÄúThis American Life‚Äù about confronting an Internet troll who impersonated her dead father and was half of the duo who initiated #shoutyourabortion, which landed her on the cover of The New York Times. She was named ‚ÄúInternet‚Äôs Most Fascinating 2015‚Äù by Cosmopolitan.com.",https://events.mtholyoke.edu/MasterCalendar/EventDetails.aspx?EventDetailId=42764,
"YA Panel: Kady Cross, Eva Darrows, & Kim Savage","English, Arts, Humanities",Odyssey Bookshop,"Sat, Apr 8, 2017",,4:00 PM,"Odyssey Bookshop, South Hadley, MA","Kim Savage, Beautiful Broken Girls
 
Remember the places you touched me.
 
Ben touched seven parts of Mira Cillo: her palm, hair, chest, cheek, lips, throat, and heart. It was the last one that broke her. After Mira's death, she sends Ben on a quest to find notes she left him in the seven places where they touched‚Äînotes that explain why she and her sister, Francesca, drowned themselves in the quarry lake. How Ben interprets those notes has everything to do with the way he was touched by a bad coach years ago. But the truth behind the girls‚Äô suicides is far more complicated, involving a dangerous infatuation, a deadly miracle, and a crushing lie. BEAUTIFUL BROKEN GIRLS is a stunning release from Kim Savage, the author of the critically acclaimed After the Woods.
 
Kim Savage was born in Quincy, Massachusetts, and received her degree in English from Stonehill College. She lives with her husband and three children north of Boston, Massachusetts. After the Woods is her debut novel.
 
Kady Cross, Vigilante
 
A brutally honest, uncompromising story about a teen girl who decides to take matters into her own hands
 
It's senior year, and Hadley and her best friend, Magda, should be starting the year together. Instead, Magda is dead and Hadley is alone. Raped at a party the year before and humiliated, Magda was driven to take her own life and Hadley is forced to see her friend's attackers in the classroom every day. Devastated, enraged and needing an outlet for her grief, Hadley decides to get a little justice of her own.
 
Donning a pink ski mask and fueled by anger, Hadley goes after each of the guys one by one, planning to strip them of their dignity and social status the way they did to Magda. As the legend of the pink-masked Vigilante begins to take on a life of its own, Hadley's revenge takes a turn for the dangerous. Could her need for vengeance lead her down a path she can't turn back from?
 
Kady Cross is a USA Today bestselling author of more than 20 books, including The Steampunk Chronicles and Sisters of Blood and Spirit. She is lucky enough to have a husband who shares her love for the slightly twisted and all things geek, and a houseful of cats with whom she shares her darkest secrets. Her love of books and makeup borders on addiction‚Äîof which she never, ever wants to be cured.
 
Eva Darrows, Dead Little Mean Girl
 
Quinn Littleton was a mean girl‚Äîa skinny blonde social terrorist in stilettos. She was everything Emma MacLaren hated. Until she died.
 
A proud geek girl, Emma loves her quiet life on the outskirts, playing video games and staying off the radar. When her nightmare of a new stepsister moves into the bedroom next door, her world is turned upside down. Quinn is a queen bee with a nasty streak who destroys anyone who gets in her way. Teachers, football players, her fellow cheerleaders‚Äîno one is safe.
 
Emma wants nothing more than to get this girl out of her life, but when Quinn dies suddenly, Emma realizes there was more to her stepsister than anyone ever realized.
 
A meaningful and humorous exploration of teen stereotypes and grief, Dead Little Mean Girl examines the labels we put on people and what lies beyond if we're only willing to look closer.

I will present work that leverages user behavioral data to build personalized applications, which I call ""behavior-powered systems"". Two applications use online user interactions:
1) WebGazer uses interaction data made on any website to continuously calibrate a webcam-based eye tracker, so that users can manipulate any web page solely by looking.
2) Drafty tracks interactions with a detailed table of computer science professors to ask the crowd of readers to help keep structured data up-to-date by inferring their interests. And two applications use mobile sensing data:
3) SleepCoacher uses smartphone sensors to capture noise and movement data while people sleep to automatically generate recommendations about how to sleep better through a continuous cycle of mini-experiments.
4) Rewind uses passive location tracking on smartphones to recreate a person's past memory through a fusion of geolocation, street side imagery, and weather data. Together, these systems show how subtle footprints of user behavior collected remotely can reimagine the way we gaze at websites, improve our sleep, experience the past, and maintain changing data.

His research in human-computer interaction focuses on behavior-powered systems, spanning the domains of mobile devices, personal informatics, and web search.

Boylan poses questions fundamental to the human experience, and answers with disarming humor and empathy. What do we owe to the people of our past? Is it possible to become someone new, or does our history determine our future? And in any life that contains a before and an after, how is it possible to be one person, not two?
 
On a warm August night in 1980, six college students are up to no good inside the dilapidated ruins of Philadelphia‚Äôs notoriously haunted Eastern State Penitentiary. It‚Äôs not long before they realize they are locked in and not alone, and the terrible night ends in tragedy. Years later, one of them‚Äîcelebrity chef Jon Casey‚Äîwill finally be charged with murder, but will Jon‚Äôs old friend Judith Carrigan testify to his innocence? Judith is protecting long-held and hard-won secrets of her own, and to defend her friend, she risks not only sacrificing the life she has fought to build but also potentially losing her husband and son. A compelling tale of murder and disappearance, Long Black Veil is also a skillful examination of the universal tension between the people we have been and the people we become.

"Hannah Tinti, The Twelve Lives of Samuel Hawley","English, Arts, Humanities",Odyssey Bookshop,"Wed, Apr 19, 2017",,7:00 PM,"Odyssey Bookshop, South Hadley, MA","Samuel Hawley isn‚Äôt like the other fathers in Olympus, Massachusetts. A loner who spent years living on the run, he raised his beloved daughter, Loo, on the road, moving from motel to motel, always watching his back. Now that Loo‚Äôs a teenager, Hawley wants only to give her a normal life. In his late wife‚Äôs hometown, he finds work as a fisherman, while Loo struggles to fit in at the local high school.
 
Growing more and more curious about the mother she never knew, Loo begins to investigate. Soon, everywhere she turns, she encounters the mysteries of her parents‚Äô lives before she was born. This hidden past is made all the more real by the twelve scars her father carries on his body. Each scar is from a bullet Hawley took over the course of his criminal career. Each is a memory: of another place on the map, another thrilling close call, another moment of love lost and found. As Loo uncovers a history that‚Äôs darker than she could have known, the demons of her father‚Äôs past spill over into the present‚Äîand together both Hawley and Loo must face a reckoning yet to come.
 
A coming-of- age novel and a literary thriller that weaves back and forth through time and across America, from Alaska to the Adirondacks, The Twelve Lives of Samuel Hawley is an unforgettable story about the cost we pay to protect the people we love most.

Hannah Tinti grew up in Salem, Massachusetts. Her short story collection Animal Crackers was a runner-up for the PEN/Hemingway Award. Her bestselling novel The Good Thief won the Center for Fiction First Novel Prize and an American Library Association Alex Award, and was a New York Times Notable Book of the Year. Tinti is the co-founder and editor-in-chief of the award-winning literary magazine One Story.

"""Three Environments for Interstellar Chemistry: Gas, Dust, and Ice"" Seminar with guest speaker, Professor Eric Herbst","Science, STEM",Amherst College,"Fri, Apr 21, 2017",,3:15pm-4:30pm,Amherst College,"Eric Herbst is the Commonwealth Professor in the Departments of Chemistry, Astronomy, and Physics at the University of Virginia.

Abstract: Stars and planets form from the collapse of portions of dense interstellar clouds, which are large assemblies of cold gas and dust (10 K) in interstellar space. The gas-phase is mainly molecular and contains many exotic species, including radicals, unusual isomers, and anions, most of which are organic in nature. Although hydrogen is the dominant element and H2 the dominant gas-phase molecule, most organic molecules are very unsaturated and are labeled ‚Äúcarbon chains‚Äù by astronomers. The dust particles are covered with ices, mainly in the form of water, CO, and CO2. During the collapse, the material evolves through a number of stages starting with an isothermal era, followed by a warm-up during which the gas-phase molecular inventory changes from a mainly exotic one to one in which most organic molecules resemble standard laboratory solvents, albeit in the gas phase. Eventually a so-called protoplanetary disk is formed around the young star, and the disk can lead to the formation of planets via coagulation of the dust particles, with an initial molecular inventory at least partially determined by the chemistry that has already occurred.

Much of what we know about the physical conditions and lifetimes of the various stages of star formation derives from molecules, which, through spectroscopy and kinetic modeling, are excellent probes of sources where they exist.1 In this talk, I will discuss the types of gas-phase and solid-state processes that synthesize molecules in assorted regions of star formation, with an emphasis on exotic gas-phase reactions and the chemistry that occurs in ice mantles.",https://www.amherst.edu/news/calendar/node/673557,

Copies of Fugitive Science will be available for purchase from Amherst Books at the event.

The book exposes the influential work of a group of black artists to confront and refute scientific racism. 

Traversing the archives of early African American literature, performance, and visual culture, Britt Rusert uncovers the dynamic experiments of a group of black writers, artists, and performers. Fugitive Science chronicles a little-known story about race and science in America. While the history of scientific racism in the nineteenth century has been well-documented, there was also a counter-movement of African Americans who worked to refute its claims.  

Far from rejecting science, these figures were careful readers of antebellum science who linked diverse fields‚Äîfrom astronomy to physiology‚Äîto both on-the-ground activism and more speculative forms of knowledge creation. Routinely excluded from institutions of scientific learning and training, they transformed cultural spaces like the page, the stage, the parlor, and even the pulpit into laboratories of knowledge and experimentation. From the recovery of neglected figures like Robert Benjamin Lewis, Hosea Easton, and Sarah Mapps Douglass, to new accounts of Martin Delany, Henry Box Brown, and Frederick Douglass, Fugitive Science makes natural science central to how we understand the origins and development of African American literature and culture. 

This distinct and pioneering book will spark interest from anyone wishing to learn more on race and society.",https://www.umass.edu/afroam/event/fugitive-science-book-party,
"Jessica Shattuck, The Women in the Castle","English, Arts, Humanities",Odyssey Bookshop,"Wed, Apr 26, 2017",,7:00 PM,"Odyssey Bookshop, South Hadley, MA","In one of the finest examples of historical fiction in recent years, Jessica Shattuck gives the reader a more complex understanding of what civilians experience living under an oppressive and cruel regime, as well as the shattered civil society that remains after the war has ended.
 
Amid the ashes of Nazi Germany's defeat, Marianne von Lingenfels returns to the once grand castle of her husband's ancestors, an imposing stone fortress now fallen into ruin following years of war. The widow of a resistor murdered in the failed July, 20, 1944, plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler, Marianne plans to uphold the promise she made to her husband's brave conspirators: to find and protect their wives, her fellow resistance widows. First, Marianne rescues six-year-old Martin, the son of her dearest childhood friend, from a Nazi reeducation home. Together, they make their way across the smoldering wreckage of their homeland to Berlin, where Martin's mother, the beautiful and na√Øve Benita, has fallen into the hands of occupying Red Army soldiers. Then she locates Ania, another resistor's wife, and her two boys, now refugees languishing in one of the many camps that house the millions displaced by the war. As Marianne assembles this makeshift family from the ruins of her husband's resistance movement, she is certain their shared pain and circumstances will hold them together. But she quickly discovers that the black-and-white, highly principled world of her privileged past has become infinitely more complicated, filled with secrets and dark passions that threaten to tear them apart. Eventually, all three women must come to terms with the choices that have defined their lives before, during, and after the war-each with their own unique share of challenges.
 
Jessica Shattuck is the award-winning author of The Hazards of Good Breeding, which was a New York Times Notable Book and finalist for the PEN/Winship Award, and Perfect Life. Her writing has appeared in the New York Times, The New Yorker, Glamour, Mother Jones, Wired, and The Believer, among other publications. A graduate of Harvard University, she received her MFA from Columbia University. She lives with her husband and three children in Brookline, Massachusetts.

Based on ultrasound-supported three-dimensional (3-D) cell culture in a multi-well microplate, the method is gentle and can be used for producing various tissue-mimicking 3-D structures in parallel. It is based on ultrasonic-standing-wave particle manipulation inside hundreds of micro-wells in the microplate. The method consists of analysis and optimization of the driving parameters of the ultrasound transducer attached to the microplate, and demonstration of the production of various micro-engineered models of solid tumors. Vilund and his colleagues have primarily used cells from HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma and A498 renal carcinoma cell lines as building blocks in the tumor models, but have also tested the method with fibroblasts, thyroid cells and melanoma cells.

The solid tumor models are characterized on-chip by detailed 3-D confocal and light-sheet microscopy, and off-chip with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Furthermore, the team has developed an image analysis-based method for cell counting and characterization in 3-D, and have studied protein expression in tumor models by FACS, comparing 2-D and 3-D cultures. The selected proteins for the analysis are relevant ligands for natural killer (NK) cell recognition. The results show differences in protein expression levels between 2-D and 3-D cultures. This is of interest when optimizing future treatment protocols in NK cell-based cancer immunotherapy.",https://www.amherst.edu/academiclife/departments/physics/seminars_and_colloquia/node/689626,

The remaining few who have an affinity for magic‚Äîthe Mageus‚Äîlive in the shadows, hiding who they are. Any Mageus who enters Manhattan becomes trapped by the Brink, a dark energy barrier that confines them to the island. Crossing it means losing their power‚Äîand often their lives.

Esta is a talented thief, and she's been raised to steal magical artifacts from the sinister Order that created the Brink. With her innate ability to manipulate time, Esta can pilfer from the past, collecting these artifacts before the Order even realizes she‚Äôs there. And all of Esta‚Äôs training has been for one final job: traveling back to 1901 to steal an ancient book containing the secrets of the Order‚Äîand the Brink‚Äîbefore the Magician can destroy it and doom the Mageus to a hopeless future.

But Old New York is a dangerous world ruled by ruthless gangs and secret societies, a world where the very air crackles with magic. Nothing is as it seems, including the Magician himself. And for Esta to save her future, she may have to betray everyone in the past.

It is known that such systems are governed by the laws of quantum mechanics, but when many quantum particles start interacting, the physics gets messy and hard to predict. To better understand these complicated systems, Hess and his colleagues built a quantum magnet from the ground up using trapped and levitated atomic ions.

Hess will discuss how they used this experimental platform to realize a new phase of matter called a discrete time crystal. These time crystals are a kind of self-stabilizing clock, a behavior which could be turned on and off by changing the interactions between the magnetic spins in the trapped ion crystal.

Accused of her rape, field hand Genus Jackson is lynched and dragged behind a truck down the Twelve-Mile Straight, the road to the nearby town. In the aftermath, the farm's inhabitants are forced to contend with their complicity in a series of events that left a man dead and a family irrevocably fractured.

Despite the prying eyes and curious whispers of the townspeople, Elma begins to raise her babies as best as she can, under the roof of her mercurial father, Juke, and with the help of Nan, the young black housekeeper who is as close to Elma as a sister. But soon it becomes clear that the ties that bind all of them together are more intricate than any could have ever imagined. As startling revelations mount, a web of lies begins to collapse around the family, destabilizing their precarious world and forcing all to reckon with the painful truth.

Acclaimed author Eleanor Henderson has returned with a novel that combines the intimacy of a family drama with the staggering presence of a great Southern saga. Tackling themes of racialized violence, social division, and financial crisis, The Twelve-Mile Straight is a startlingly timely, emotionally resonant, and magnificent tour de force.

He had grown up at a violent time in New York history in a small, vulnerable family unable to keep him from an adolescence dominated by fear of Manhattan gangs, life in Greenwich Village and an enigmatic parental charade.
Meltsner would come of age in the sixties filing hundreds of lawsuits to integrate major southern institutions and arguing dozens of them before the Supreme Court and lower federal courts. He represented Muhammad Ali in the case that removed legal barriers barring his return to the boxing ring after refusing induction in the Army, tried the case that led to the integration of southern hospitals and was one of the initiators of the campaign that resulted in a nine-year moratorium of the use of capital punishment.

As a professor at Columbia Law School, Meltsner was a co-founder of the school's first poverty law clinic, a program that trained law students by giving them actual experience working with clients and in the courts. In 1979, he became the dean of the Northeastern Law School in Boston, where he is the Matthews Distinguished University Professor of Law; from 2000 to 2004 he was a visiting professor at Harvard Law School and Director of its experimental First Year Lawyering Program.

Michael Meltsner has been a Guggenheim Fellow and a Prize Fellow of the American Academy of Berlin. He has served as a consultant to the United States Department of Justice, the Ford Foundation and the Carnegie Foundation, which sent him to South Africa in 1978 to help set up a law defense fund to advocate against Apartheid. The author of five previous books including Cruel and Unusual: The Supreme Court and Capital Punishment (Random House, 1973) and a novel, Short Takes (Random House) in 1979, he is also a licensed marriage and family therapist.

The event is open to the campus and the public.

Physics Department Seminar: Problems in Human Motion Planning,"Science, Math, STEM",Umass Amherst,"Thu, Sep 28, 2017",,11:30 AM,"Umass Amherst, Amherst, MA","Refreshments at 11:15am

Moving through a densely-populated environment can be surprisingly hard, owing to the problem of congestion. Learning to deal with congestion in crowds and in networks is a long-standing and urgently-studied problem, one that can be equally well described at the level of dense, correlated matter or at the level of game-theoretical decision making. In this talk I describe two related problems associated with motion planning in congested environments. In the first part I consider a description of pedestrian crowds as densely-packed repulsive particles, and I address the question: what is the form of the pedestrian-pedestrian interaction law?  In the second part of the talk I examine a simple model of a traffic network and study how inefficiency in the traffic flow arises from ""selfish"" decision-making. Analysis of the model reveals a surprising connection between Nash equilibria from game theory and percolative phase transitions from statistical physics.",https://www.cns.umass.edu/news-events/events/2017-09-28-problems-human-motion-planning,

In 1982, twelve-year-old Reza has no interest in joining Iran‚Äôs war effort against Iraq. But in the wake of a tragedy and at his mother‚Äôs urging, he decides to enlist, assured by the authorities that he will achieve paradise should he die in service to his country.

War does not bring the glory the boys of Iran have been promised, and Reza soon finds himself held in a prisoner-of-war camp in Iraq, where the guards not only threaten violence‚Äîthey act upon it. Will Reza make it out alive? And if he does, will he even have a home to return to? Friendship, heartbreak, and Reza‚Äôs very survival are at stake as he finds solace through music and forges his own path‚Äîwherever that might take him.
 
Darcey Rosenblatt writes for middle grade and teenage people because she believes for them stories can be life changing ‚Äì they were for her.

YA Panel: Dick Lehr & Francisco X. Stork,"Litearture, Humanities","The Odyssey Bookshop, Holyoke Community College","Fri, Sep 29, 2017",,11:00 AM,"Holyoke Community College, Holyoke, MA","Trell
 
From the co-author of Black Mass comes a gripping YA novel inspired by the true story of a young man‚Äôs false imprisonment for murder ‚Äî and those who fought to free him.
 
On a hot summer night in the late 1980s, in the Boston neighborhood of Roxbury, a twelve-year-old African-American girl was sitting on a mailbox talking with her friends when she became the innocent victim of gang-related gunfire. Amid public outcry, an immediate manhunt was on to catch the murderer, and a young African-American man was quickly apprehended, charged, and ‚Äî wrongly ‚Äî convicted of the crime. Dick Lehr, a former reporter for the Boston Globe‚Äôs famous Spotlight Team who investigated this case for the newspaper, now turns the story into Trell, a page-turning novel about the daughter of an imprisoned man who persuades a reporter and a lawyer to help her prove her father‚Äôs innocence. What pieces of evidence might have been overlooked? Can they manage to get to the truth before a dangerous character from the neighborhood gets to them?
 
Dick Lehr is a professor of journalism at Boston University. From 1985 to 2003, he was a reporter at the Boston Globe, where he was a Pulitzer Prize finalist in investigative reporting and won numerous regional and national journalism awards. He served as the Globe's legal affairs reporter, magazine and feature writer, and as a longtime member of the newspaper's investigative reporting unit, the Spotlight Team. Before that, Lehr, who is also an attorney, was a reporter at The Hartford Courant.
 
Lehr is the author of The Fence: A Police Cover-up Along Boston's Racial Divide, a non-fiction narrative about the worst known case of police brutality in Boston, which was an Edgar Award finalist for best non-fiction. He is coauthor of the New York Times bestseller and Edgar Award winner Black Mass: Whitey Bulger, the FBI and a Devil's Deal, and its sequel, Whitey: The Life of America's Most Notorious Mob Boss.
 
Lehr was a John S. Knight Journalism Fellow at Stanford University in 1991-1992. He lives outside Boston with his wife and four children.
 
 
Disappeared 
 
You've never read a Francisco X. Stork novel like this before! A missing girl, a determined reporter, and a young man on the brink combine for a powerful story of choices, suspense, and survival. Four Months Ago: Sara Zapata's best friend disappeared, kidnapped by the web of criminals who terrorize Juarez. Four Hours Ago: Sara received a death threat ‚Äî and with it, a clue to the place where her friend is locked away. Four Weeks Ago: Emiliano Zapata fell in love with Perla Rubi, who will never be his so long as he's poor. Four Minutes Ago: Emiliano got the chance to make more money than he ever dreamed ‚Äî just by joining the web. In the next four days, Sara and Emiliano will each face impossible choices, between life and justice, friends and family, truth and love. But when the web closes in on Sara, only one path remains for the siblings: the way across the desert to the United States.
 
Francisco Xavier Arguelles was born in 1953 in Monterrey, Mexico. His mother, Ruth Arguelles, was a single woman from a middle-class family in Tampico. Six years later Ruth married Charles Stork, a retired man of Dutch ancestry, who adopted Francisco. When Francisco announced that he wanted to be a writer, Charlie gave him a portable typewriter for his seventh birthday. Two years later, Francisco and his family moved to El Paso, Texas, where he was sent to grammar school to learn English. As a teenager, Francisco was given a scholarship to the local Jesuit academy and soon rose to the top of his class. Based on his success there, he received an honors scholarship to attend Spring Hill College, a small Jesuit school in Mobile, Alabama. Francisco majored in English literature and philosophy and received the college‚Äùs creative writing prize. He was awarded the prestigious Danforth Fellowship to attend graduate school at Harvard University, where he studied Latin American literature with writers like Octavio Paz, the Mexican Nobel Laureate. After four years at Harvard, Francisco went to Columbia Law School, planning to make a living as a lawyer while writing fiction. Twenty years, and twelve or so legal jobs later, he published his first novel for adults, The Way of the Jaguar. Francisco X. Stork works in Boston as an attorney for a state agency that develops affordable housing. He is married and has two adult children.

Native leaders, artists and activists have used a variety of innovative tools toward reclamation and revitalization, including technologies like writing, filmmaking, and unexpected digital forms. She will discuss the ways in which environmental and social justice are often intertwined and lay the groundwork for imagining alternative futures through the renewal of relationships of alliance and reciprocity.

Brooks is associate professor of English and American studies at Amherst College. Her first book, The Common Pot: The Recovery of Native Space in the Northeast, reframes the historical and literary landscape of the northeast, and received the Media Ecology Association's Dorothy Lee Award for Outstanding Scholarship in the Ecology of Culture in 2011. Although deeply rooted in her Abenaki homeland, Brooks‚Äôs work has been widely influential in a global network of scholars. She served on the inaugural Council of the Native American and Indigenous Studies Association (NAISA), and currently serves on the editorial boards of SAIL and Ethnohistory. She also works on the advisory board of Gedakina, a non-profit organization focused on Indigenous cultural revitalization, traditional ecological knowledge, and community wellness in New England.

Freedman Panel: 'Universal Basic Income - History and Theory of a Utopian',"Social Justice, History, Humanities, Diversity/Equity/Inclusion, Global Studies, Math",Umass Amherst,"Mon, Oct 16, 2017",,4:00 PM,"Umass Amherst, Amherst, MA","Universal Basic Income (UBI) is a form of social security that has been gaining traction worldwide as a means of providing income to those unable to work and thereby reducing poverty, improving equality, increasing quality of life and providing economic security to citizens. Proponents of UBI have theorized that putting such a system into place could potentially even eradicate poverty altogether, while reducing the bureaucracy associated with current methods of social welfare assistance provision and also boosting economic growth.
Recent advances in artificial intelligence, robotics, and related technologies challenge the notion that plentiful jobs will be available for those seeking work. Self-driving trucks, for example, could spur the elimination of hundreds of thousands or even millions of jobs, many of which will not be replaced. If many citizens are unable to find traditional work, both individuals and society will need to adapt to a new social and economic reality. How should society support those who cannot find work because technology has displaced jobs?
In this moderated panel discussion UBI experts Connie Razza, Seth Ackerman and Elizabeth Rhodes will discuss the history of this theory and the implications of putting such a system in place.
Razza is director of strategic research at the Center for Popular Democracy and co-director of policy and research at Demos, a public policy organization.
Ackerman is a member of the editorial board of Jacobin, where he has published prominently on Universal Basic Income reform.
Rhodes is research director for the Basic Income Project, Y Combinator Research.

This crisis, argues Briggs, fuels all others‚Äîfrom immigration to gay marriage, anti-feminism to the rise of the Tea Party.

"Robert Olmstead, Savage Country","Literature, Humanities",The Odyssey Bookshop,"Tue, Oct 24, 2017",,7:00 PM,"South Hadley, MA","In September 1873, Elizabeth Coughlin, a widow bankrupted by her husband's folly and death, embarks on a buffalo hunt with her estranged and mysterious brother-in-law, Michael. With no money, no family, no job or security, she hopes to salvage something of her former life and the lives of the hired men and their families who depend on her. The buffalo hunt that her husband had planned, she now realizes, was his last hope for saving their land.
 
Elizabeth and Michael plunge south across the aptly named Deadline demarcating Indian Territory from their home state, Kansas. Nothing could have prepared them for the dangers: rattlesnakes, rabies, wildfire, lightning strikes, blue northers, flash floods, threats to life in so many ways. They're on borrowed time: the Comanche are in winter quarters, and the cruel work of slaughtering the buffalo is unraveling their souls. They must get back alive.
 
This is a gripping narrative of that infamous hunt, which drove the buffalo population to near extinction--the story of a moment in our history in which mass destruction of an animal population was seen as the only route to economic solvency. But it's also the intimate story of how that hunt changed Michael and Elizabeth forever.

Robert Olmstead is the author of six previous books. Coal Black Horse was the winner of the Heartland Prize for Fiction and the Ohioana Award, was a #1 Book Sense Pick, and was a Borders Original Voices pick. Robert is the recipient of a Guggenheim fellowship and an NEA grant, and he is currently a professor at Ohio Wesleyan University.

Shaping a Usable Past: The 1917 Centennial in Contemporary Russian Political Discourse,"History, Humanities, Global Studies",Smith College,"Wed, Oct 25, 2017",,5:00-6:30pm,"Smith College, Northampton, MA","Professor Gorham will discuss how the centennial commemoration of the Russian Revolution has found expression in current Russian political discourse, spanning both traditional journalism and new media outlets. Debates over historical representation have played an integral role in the language politics of
post-Soviet Russian culture, and the complex place of 1917 in forms of collective identity and memory exemplifies this phenomenon. Professor Gorham‚Äôs lecture will address how this search for a ‚Äúusable past,‚Äù undertaken for competing political ends, has played out on Russian Internet and new media platforms.
Michael S. Gorham is Professor of Russian Studies at the University of Florida. Trained in Russian linguistics, literature, and cultural studies, his research explores the intersection of language, culture and politics in Russia, focusing on periods of social transition. Professor Gorham‚Äôs current projects explore Russian language politics and civil communication in the context of the Internet and new media technologies, which have reconfigured the Russian public sphere of the Putin era. He is the author of ""Speaking in Soviet Tongues: Language Culture and the Politics of Voice in Early Soviet Russia"" (Northern Illinois University Press, 2003) and ""After Newspeak: Language Culture and Politics in Russia from Gorbachev to Putin"" (Cornell University Press, 2014), as well as the co-editor of the volume ""Digital Russia: The Language, Culture, and Politics of New Media Communication"" (Routledge, 2014).

Lecture: 'Invest in Minds Not Missiles' with MIT Biologist Jonathan King,"Science, Social Justice, Diversity/Equity/Inclusion, Humanities, Global Studies",Umass Amherst,"Wed, Oct 25, 2017",,4:00 PM,"Umass Amherst, Amherst, MA","""Invest in Minds not Missiles: Resisting the Trillion-Dollar Nuclear Weapons Escalation""
A lecture by MIT biologist and Science for the People member Jonathan King
Sponsored by Western Mass Science for the People and the Political Economy Research Institute
Co-sponsors: Massachusetts Society of Professors, Public Higher Education Network of Massachusetts, UMass History Department, UMass Social Thought & Political Economy Program, Northampton Committee to Stop the Wars
The growth of higher education and university-based scientific research in the U.S. after WWII has been critically dependent on federal investments, voted annually as part of the congressional discretionary budget. In recent years more than 55% of this budget‚Äîour income taxes‚Äîhas been spent on war and weapon purchase accounts. Recently President Trump proposed more cuts in key programs supporting education and research‚Äîincluding NIH, NSF, EPA, and NOAA‚Äîin order to fund a $54 billion increase (~10%) in military spending. This will bring the fraction of our tax dollars spent on preparation for war to more than 60% of the total congressional budget. Many of the weapons programs‚Äîsuch as the proposed trillion-dollar nuclear weapons ‚Äúmodernization‚Äù‚Äîare provocative and destabilizing, more likely to decrease national security than increase it. The excessive costs will greatly weaken programs addressing social needs. Defending higher education and basic research will require explicitly resisting the diversion of our tax dollars to military accounts.

Morgan Babst, The Floating World","Literature, Humanities",The Odyssey Bookshop,"Mon, Oct 30, 2017",,7:00 PM,"South Hadley, MA","A dazzling debut about family, home, and grief, The Floating World takes readers into the heart of Hurricane Katrina with the story of the Boisdores, whose roots stretch back nearly to the foundation of New Orleans. Though the storm is fast approaching the Louisiana coast, Cora, the family's fragile elder daughter, refuses to leave the city, forcing her parents, Joe Boisdore, an artist descended from a freed slave who became one of the city's preeminent furniture makers, and his white ""Uptown"" wife, Dr. Tess Eshleman, to evacuate without her, setting off a chain of events that leaves their marriage in shambles and Cora catatonic--the victim or perpetrator of some violence mysterious even to herself.
 
This mystery is at the center of C. Morgan Babst's haunting, lyrical novel. Cora's sister, Del, returns to New Orleans from the life she has tried to build in New York City to find her hometown in ruins and her family deeply alienated from one another. As Del attempts to figure out what happened to her sister, she must also reckon with the racial history of the city, and the trauma of destruction that was not, in fact, some random act of God, but an avoidable tragedy visited upon New Orleans's most helpless and forgotten citizens.
 
The Floating World is the Katrina story that needed to be told--one with a piercing, unforgettable loveliness and a nuanced understanding of this particular place and its tangled past, written by a New Orleans native who herself says that after Katrina, ""if you were blind, suddenly you saw.
 
C. Morgan Babst studied writing at NOCCA, Yale, and N.Y.U. Her essays and short fiction have appeared in such journals as The Oxford American, Guernica, the Harvard Review,LitHub, the New Orleans Review, and her piece, 'Death Is a Way to Be,' was honored as a Notable Essay in Best American Essays 2016.

Who Put Those Genes in My Food??  Facts and Myths About ‚ÄúGMOs‚Äù ,"Science, Sustainability",Smith College,"Fri, Nov 3, 2017",,7:30-8:30pm,"Smith College, Northampton, MA","by Margaret Smith, PhD., Plant Breeding and Genetics, Cornell University
7:30 pm, Campus Center Carroll Room, followed by a reception at the Lyman Plant House and a preview of the Chrysanthemum Show in the illuminated Lyman Conservatory

Genetically engineered crops (so-called ‚ÄúGMOs‚Äù) have generated much controversy in recent years. People have raised issues of legitimate concern, but also concerns that are misguided at best and completely inaccurate at worst.  This presentation highlights common concerns about genetically engineered crops including what types are grown, how much area they occupy, farm-level impacts of their adoption, food and feed safety, who ‚Äúowns‚Äù these traits, and the debate about labeling. Margaret Smith will summarize the relevant scientific information about these concerns and point out which concerns are questions of public values rather than scientific issues.  The goal is to help listeners better understand genetically engineered crops and to provide clear, objective, and factual information that they can use to form their own opinions.

Margaret Smith joined the Cornell faculty in 1987 in plant breeding and genetics.  Since 2008 she has served as the associate director of the Cornell University Agricultural Experiment Station, and devoted the other half of her time to research and extension in plant breeding.  Her research is primarily on field corn and emphasizes breeding for yield and adaptation in New York growing conditions, improving insect and disease resistance, and breeding for organic systems.  As the extension leader for plant breeding and genetics, Margaret conducts educational programs on crop varieties and seeds for agricultural audiences, and on crop genetic engineering for a wide range of public audiences.",https://www.smith.edu/garden/event/fall-chrysanthemum-show-opening-lecture,

The abstract of the talk is as follows: Over the twentieth century, it became more difficult for children born to poorer parents to climb the socioeconomic ladder. Declining upward mobility in the United States is now understood as a local problem, which could be addressed through place-based policy. Relatively little is known, however, of the malleability or historical evolution of places with respect to mobility outcomes. This article uses a new linked sample of over three million parents and children to study the historical geography of opportunity. This analysis reveals dramatic change in which places promoted and constrained upward mobility over the twentieth century. This changing geography of opportunity appears to have been partially precipitated by cycles of regional economic development. The territorial imprint of historical race relations, immigration and ethnic diversity, in contrast, is still evident in mobility differences today. This research suggests that strategies aimed at enhancing upward mobility should promote economic opportunity while contending with more deeply rooted differences between places.

And although these patterns don‚Äôt doom women to electoral failure, they raise a formidable series of obstacles that complicate women‚Äôs path to elective office. Or so the conventional wisdom goes. This lecture will challenge that prevailing view and argue that the declining novelty of women in politics, coupled with the polarization of the Republican and Democratic parties, has left little space for the sex of a candidate to influence modern campaigns. Based on an in-depth analysis of the 2010 and 2014 congressional elections, Jennifer L. Lawless will demonstrate that male and female House candidates communicate similar messages on the campaign trail, receive similar coverage in the local press, and garner similar evaluations from voters in their districts. Gender is by no means irrelevant, but when they run for office, male and female candidates don‚Äôt just perform equally well on Election Day -- they also face a very similar electoral landscape. The problem for women‚Äôs representation, however, if that women are less likely than men to throw their hats into the electoral ring in the first place.

Speaker: Ronitt Rubinfeld, Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Massachusetts Institute of Technology
Abstract:  Consider a setting in which inputs to and outputs from a computational problem are so large, that there is not time to read them in their entirety.   However, if one is only interested in small parts of the output at any given time, is it really necessary to solve the entire computational problem? Is it even necessary to view the whole input? We survey recent work in the model of  ""local computation algorithms"" which for a given input, supports queries by a user to values of  specified bits of a legal output.  The goal is to design local computation algorithms in such a way that very little of the input needs to be seen in order to determine the value of any single bit of the output.

In this talk, we describe results on a variety of problems for which sublinear time and space local computation algorithms have been developed -- we will give special focus to finding maximal independent sets and sparse  spanning graphs.",https://www.cics.umass.edu/event/local-computation-algorithms,
