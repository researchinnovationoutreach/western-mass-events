Fellows participate in the Pines, Sarna, Statfeld Summer Institute for the Museum Teacher Fellowship Program held at the Museum in Washington, DC.

Helping students maximize learning in all areas of life requires quality instructional methods based on an understanding of these cognitive abilities associated with different regions of the brain and ways to measure these abilities.

The 2017 workshop has not yet been announced.

The 2016 Workshop was ""The Rise of Populist Movements Across Europe and Russia."" 

The last few years have witnessed the rise of populist movements both within the United States and abroad. In the US we have seen a movement away from establishment candidates with the rise of Donald Trump and the success of Bernie Sanders. In Europe, the populist parties, France‚Äôs National Front, Britain‚Äôs UKIP, Poland‚Äôs Law and Justice party, Jobbik in Hungary, Austria‚Äôs Freedom Party, and Greece‚Äôs SYRIZA (to name a few) have gained in vote share. In Russia, there are various radical right organizations and parties ranging from the Night Wolves nationalist biker gang to Vladimir Zhirinovsky‚Äôs LDPR.

Voters have come to rally around the idea of ousting establishment candidates and finding those who appeal to the ‚Äúeveryday person,‚Äù the person who is not afraid to stand-up and voice their opinion.

What has led to the success of such parties and candidates in recent years? Is it the economy that has pushed voters more to the extreme sides of the ideological spectrum? Is it a fear of the ‚Äúother‚Äù that is driving the movement? Is this just an aberration that will resolve itself in a few years‚Äô time or is it the new normal?

The one-day event is designed to consider current electoral trends in Europe and Russia.Teachers will discuss and debate current electoral, economic, and multicultural issues facing Europe and Russia to equip themselves with the tools necessary to teach complicated and controversial subjects in schools and community college settings. Participants will consider how changing demographics affect both national and common European senses of identity and the effects of the economy on electoral outcomes. The confluence of events in Syria, the slow recovery from the recent financial crisis, and recent terror attacks all play a role in the electoral process, but how?",https://jsis.washington.edu/ellisoncenter/events/summer-teacher-workshop/,,
