In this lecture, Ticktin is concerned by the ways in which border walls and zones come not simply to defend (i.e. certain territories), but to define  -- that is, to shape or alter categories of natural and human kinds. She will suggest that borders walls, and all the surrounding and auxiliary technologies they harness, work by shifting how we understand different kinds of beings, ultimately rendering certain kinds killable.

Trade-offs in Campaign Finance Reform: Less Money or More Donors,"History, Humanities",Umass Amherst School of Public Policy,"Mon, Mar 6, 2017",,12:15-1:15pm,"Umass Amherst, Amherst, MA","The School of Public Policy (SPP) will kick off its Spring 2017 Faculty Colloquium series with a talk by Meredith Rolfe, associate professor of political science.

Rolfe‚Äôs talk, ‚ÄúTrade-offs in Campaign Finance Reform: Less Money or More Donors,‚Äù will draw on her recent paper about that topic. In an era where the role of big money in politics has come under increased scrutiny and voters are concerned about potential corruption in the political system, there is increasing interest in the public financing of political campaigns. Reformers have argued that adoption of public financing systems, particularly voucher systems such as Seattle‚Äôs innovative Democracy Vouchers program, can increase citizen participation in election financing, reduce the inequality among donors, reduce corruption, and attract a wider range of competitive candidates.
In the paper, Rolfe and her collaborators formally model the structural constraints present in all campaign finance systems, such as the fixed relationship between total campaign spending, average contribution size and total number of donors. They find that prior analysis may significantly overstate the ability of public funding programs such as those in Seattle to generate significant increases in the number of people who donate to political campaigns. Instead, structural limits on campaign spending and candidate participation may result in an overall decrease in the proportion of citizens donating to municipal elections. Their analysis highlights the inherent trade-offs in any campaign finance policy between the goals of increasing donor participation, limiting campaign spending, and reducing inequality among donors.

Upon the election of Trump as President of the US, undocumented immigrant students and their allies scrambled to strategize mechanisms of support for those who feared losing their protected status under Obama's 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) executive order. Given that Trump has explicitly said he will repeal DACA and take an aggressive and enforcement-only approach to immigration more broadly, the already precarious situation for all immigrants living in the US seemed all the more dire. University committees, student groups, and academic organizations began strategizing about what it would mean to make universities ""sanctuaries"" for undocumented students. Several hundred university presidents signed on to a letter in Dec. 2016 declaring their support for undocumented students, though the terms of that support was unspecified. This paper considers the various dimensions of the question of the university as a sanctuary space as posed in popular discourse, what it might mean for the university to actually be safe, or at least safer for its most marginalized residents, and how these questions might open new space to think about ways revise, recreate and promote the mission of the public university amid conservative backlash, austerity, and privatization.

Ch√°vez's scholarship is primarily informed by queer of color theory and women of color feminism. Methodologically, she is a rhetorical critic who variously utilizes textual and field based methods. She is interested in studying social movement building, activist rhetoric, and coalitional politics. Her work emphasizes the rhetorical practices of groups marginalized within existing power structures, but she also attends to rhetoric produced by powerful institutions and actors about marginalized folks and the systems that oppress them (e.g., immigration system, prisons etc.).

During the suppression of Jerusalem by the Syrian king Antiochus Epiphanes that led to the Maccabean revolt, we are told that ""a man could not even admit to being a Ioudaios."" The question is, what could he not admit to being? The word is variously translated as ""Judean"" or ""Jew."" The debate concerns two views of ethnicity, a primordialist one that puts the emphasis on blood and land, and a constructivist one that places the emphasis on practices and way of life. This lecture will use the Maccabean crisis as a lens to view the balance between these two views, each of which has some basis in early Judaism.",https://www.smith.edu/about-smith/new-calendar?trumbaEmbed=view%3Devent%26eventid%3D217363748,

This talk argues that the national fraternity of American motorists excluded African Americans during the early to mid-twentieth century despite the ostensibly democratic nature of the ‚Äúopen road.‚Äù Providing a textured account of the emotional lives of black drivers including the sense of pride, the seduction, and the exhilaration that owning a car offered, this talk also considers the fears and anxieties that arose once African Americans motorists got behind the wheel. The road was (and certainly, still is) a site of racial contestation. This talk calls for a reconsideration of ‚Äúautomobility‚Äù and the role of the car in African American culture. 

Allyson Hobbs is an associate professor in the department of distory and Director of African and African American Studies at Stanford University.  She is a contributing staff writer for the New Yorker.com and a Distinguished Lecturer for the Organization of American Historians. Allyson‚Äôs first book, A Chosen Exile: A History of Racial Passing in American Life, published by Harvard University Press in 2014, examines the phenomenon of racial passing in the United States from the late eighteenth century to the present.

Concert: Magic Triangle Jazz Series presents: Mary Halvorson's Reverse Blue,"Arts, Music",Umass Amherst,"Mon, Mar 27, 2017",,8:00 PM,"Umass Amherst, Amherst, MA","Free admission.

The Magic Triangle Jazz Series, produced by the Fine Arts Center at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, in collaboration with the Smith College Department of Music, continues its 28th season with a performance by Mary Halvorson‚Äôs Reverse Blue, featuring Mary Halvorson, guitar, Chris Speed, saxophone, clarinet, Eivind Opsvik, bass and Tomas Fujiwara, drums. The concert is free and open to the public.

One of improvised music‚Äôs most in-demand guitarists, Mary Halvorson has been active in New York since 2002, following jazz studies at Wesleyan University and the New School. Critics have called her ‚Äúa singular talent‚Äù (Lloyd Sachs, JazzTimes), ‚ÄúNYC‚Äôs least-predictable improviser‚Äù (Howard Mandel, City Arts), ‚Äúone of the most exciting and original guitarists in jazz‚Äîor otherwise‚Äù (Steve Dollar, Wall Street Journal), and ‚Äúone of today‚Äôs most formidable bandleaders‚Äù (Francis Davis, Village Voice). 

After three years of study with visionary composer and saxophonist Anthony Braxton, Halvorson became an active member of several of his bands, including his trio, septet and 12+1tet. To date, she has appeared on six of Braxton‚Äôs recordings. Halvorson has also performed alongside iconic guitarist Marc Ribot, in his bands Sun Ship and The Young Philadelphians, and with the bassist Trevor Dunn in his Trio-Convulsant. Over the past decade she has worked with such diverse bandleaders as Tim Berne, Taylor Ho Bynum, Ingrid Laubrock, Myra Melford, Jason Moran, Joe Morris, Tom Rainey and Mike Reed.

As a bandleader and composer, one of Ms. Halvorson‚Äôs primary outlet is her longstanding trio, featuring bassist John H√©bert and drummer Ches Smith. Since their 2008 debut album, Dragon‚Äôs Head, the band has been recognized as a rising star jazz band by Downbeat Magazine for five consecutive years. Ms. Halvorson‚Äôs quintet, which adds trumpeter Jonathan Finlayson and alto saxophonist Jon Irabagon to the trio, has released two critically acclaimed albums on the Firehouse 12 label: Saturn Sings and Bending Bridges. Most recently she has added two additional band members‚Äîtenor saxophonist Ingrid Laubrock and trombonist Jacob Garchik‚Äîto form a septet, featured on her 2013 release, Illusionary Sea. Halvorson also co-leads a longstanding chamber-jazz duo with violist Jessica Pavone, the avant-rock band People and the collective ensembles Thumbscrew and Secret Keeper.

‚ÄúIn the past few years, Mary Halvorson, already an acclaimed member of New York's Downtown improv scene, has been earning widespread recognition as a bandleader and composer of note,‚Äù writes Troy Collins. ‚ÄúHer writing displays an increasing sophistication with each new effort, revealing a compositional maturity as distinctive as her idiosyncratic guitar technique. Her latest ensemble, Reverse Blue, first performed at NYC's Blue Note as part of Search and Restore's ‚ÄòSpontaneous Constructions‚Äô series. Despite their mixed pedigree, there is an aesthetic similarity amongst the tunes that lends a sense of stylistic cohesion to the proceedings. Cohesive, yet varied enough to signify its collaborative nature, Reverse Blue is another exceptional release from one of today's most adventurous artists.‚Äù",http://www.umass.edu/events/concert-magic-triangle-jazz-0,

Her interest in women's life and career obstacles led her to work as a research associate and principal interviewer for Project Access, a landmark Harvard University study funded by the National Science Foundation, the Office of Naval Research, and the Bunting Institute.  Project Access explored impediments to women's careers in science -- the hindrances, both internal and external, that prevent women from rising to the tops of their fields.  Sara's efforts contributed to the publication of two seminar studies in this field, Gender Differences in Science Careers: The Project Access Study and Who Succeeds in Science?  The Gender Dimension, both by G. Sonnert, assisted by G. Holton.
In high demand as a speaker, Sara lectures and teaches workshops about women and negotiation for colleges and universities, law firms, government agencies, corporate audiences, and women's leadership conferences in the U.S. and around the world.

It investigates the particular set of aesthetic and social forces and desires that result in and emerge from the seemingly simple phenomenon of black people looking at each other. Is that phenomenon an action or an event? Does that looking presuppose or produce subjects and objects? What work does such looking do on or for or to or against the world? In addressing these questions, the talk also seeks to contribute to an analysis of class struggle in black studies.

Indigenous languages emphasize the animacy of the land, and all the living beings who rely upon the land‚Äôs sustenance for survival.

From Abortion Rights to Social Justice: Building the Movement for Reproductive Freedom,"Humanities, History, Global Studies, Diversity/Equity/Inclusion, Women's Studies",Civil Liberties and Public Policy (CLPP) and Hampshire College,"Fri, Apr 7, 2017","Sun, Apr 9, 2017",All day,"Hampshire College, Amherst, MA","From Abortion Rights to Social Justice: Building the Movement for Reproductive Freedom is the conference where CLPP invites people who are completely new to reproductive and social justice to learn alongside those who have shaped, shaken up, and laid new ground for our movements for years. We are students, activists, researchers, scholars, advocates, and justice-seekers. We come together. We vision. We share our successes and challenges. We hold each other accountable. We share our experiences. 
 
With lifelong activists, newly inspired justice-seekers, veteran CLPP conference goers, and first-timers, the conference home that we are creating is approaching its 40th year. We celebrate our strength because we survive and share our resources so that we continue to thrive.  We come together to share power and build new skills. We come together to build the movement for reproductive freedom. We come home.
 
Our communities are strong and resilient. The reproductive justice movement was birthed by women of color who said, We can‚Äôt experience our power without abortion, without support for our families, without celebrating our choices to parent or not to parent, and without justice. At the annual CLPP conference, we join together to celebrate this strong legacy of justice-making and to build our movements.
 
At the conference, we strive to create a space where those at the frontlines of our struggles for justice are centered and our lived experiences are valued. Our vision is to create a home for the visible leadership of those most impacted by reproductive injustices: women of color, trans women, LGBTQ people, those who have been incarcerated, poor and working class people, youth, students, people with disabilities, immigrants, indigenous people, and others who are most acutely affected by reproductive, environmental, and social injustices. 
 
We come together to listen and learn, to hold space to respond to the traumas inflicted upon our communities. We know that coming home is not always comfortable. We interrogate our discomfort. We expand our conversations about race and racism‚Äîabout white supremacy‚Äîaffirming that Black Lives Matter is central to achieving reproductive justice. 
 
We know that coming home is hard work. At the CLPP conference, we center our desires for justice, and we hold back the tide. We vision for ourselves, our communities, our environments, and our society. 
 
We celebrate the ways that we are creating the world that we want to live in. We tell our stories of abortions that we wanted, that we didn‚Äôt want, that we had to fight for, and that we could not live without. We celebrate our creations‚Äîour art, our stories, our families, our communities. We tell stories of the children and families we have had to fight to create. We celebrate through story, and we envision a world where each of us experiences power, pleasure, and autonomy.
 
Come home to the CLPP conference to be inspired. Come to the conference to recalibrate for action. Come to celebrate the beauty and resilience of our movements. Reconnect with old friends, meet new strategic partners and mentors. Come create space with your communities and with new communities‚Äîto build a vision centering diverse histories, identities, experiences and narratives. We don‚Äôt all come to the CLPP conference as leaders, but we all take back new stories and skills to empower our communities.  
 
We hope you will share both your experiences and your desire to learn with us on April 7-9, 2017. Join us to find out how your work, your communities, and the issues you care about are part of the movement we are building for reproductive freedom.",https://clpp.hampshire.edu/conference/2017-conference,
